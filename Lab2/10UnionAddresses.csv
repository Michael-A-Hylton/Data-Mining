George Washington, October-25-1791, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-George-Washington-October-25-1791, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsGeorge-Washington-October-25-1791-speech," Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: ""In vain may we expect peace with the Indians on our frontiers so long as a lawless set of unprincipled wretches can violate the rights of hospitality; or infringe the most solemn treaties; without receiving the punishment they so justly merit."" I meet you upon the present occasion with the feelings which are naturally inspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situations of our common country; and by a persuasion equally strong that the labors of the session which has just commenced will; under the guidance of a spirit no less prudent than patriotic; issue in measures conducive to the stability and increase of national prosperity. Numerous as are the providential blessings which demand our grateful acknowledgments; the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the industry of the husbandman is too important to escape recollection. Your own observations in your respective situations will have satisfied you of the progressive state of agriculture; manufactures; commerce; and navigation. In tracing their causes you will have remarked with particular pleasure the happy effects of that revival of confidence; public as well as private; to which the Constitution and laws of the United States have so eminently contributed; and you will have observed with no less interest new and decisive proofs of the increasing reputation and credit of the nation. But you nevertheless can not fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstances which will be disclosed in the several official communications that will be made to you in the course of your deliberations. The rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States; which completed the sum allowed to be subscribed in a single day; is among the striking and pleasing evidences which present themselves; not only of confidence in the Government; but of resource in the community. In the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution of the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws and resolutions of the last session. Among the most important of these is the defense and security of the western frontiers. To accomplish it on the most humane principles was a primary wish. Accordingly; at the same time the treaties have been provisionally concluded and other proper means used to attach the wavering and to confirm in their friendship the well-disposed tribes of Indians; effectual measures have been adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible that a pacification was desired upon terms of moderation and justice. Those measures having proved unsuccessful; it became necessary to convince the refractory of the power of the United States to punish their depredations. Offensive operations have therefore been directed; to be conducted; however; as consistently as possible with the dictates of humanity. Some of these have been crowned with full success and others are yet depending. The expeditions which have been completed were carried on under the authority and at the expense of the United States by the militia of Kentucky; whose enterprise; intrepidity; and good conduct are entitled of peculiar commendation. Overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded tribes; and considerable numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all further opposition; removed from their former situations; and placed themselves under the immediate protection of the United States. It is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion in future may cease and that an intimate intercourse may succeed; calculated to advance the happiness of the Indians and to attach them firmly to the United States. In order to this it seems necessaryâ€”That they should experience the benefits of an impartial dispensation of justice. That the mode of alienating their lands; the main source of discontent and war; should be so defined and regulated as to obviate imposition and as far as may be practicable controversy concerning the reality and extent of the alienations which are made. That commerce with them should be promoted under regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment toward them; and that such rational experiments should be made for imparting to them the blessings of civilization as may from time to time suit their condition. That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ the means to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their immediate interests with the preservation of peace. And that efficacious provision should be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those who; by violating their rights; shall infringe the treaties and endanger the peace of the Union. A system corresponding with the mild principles of religion and philanthropy toward an unenlightened race of men; whose happiness materially depends on the conduct of the United States; would be as honorable to the national character as conformable to the dictates of sound policy. The powers specially vested in me by the act laying certain duties on distilled spirits; which respect the subdivisions of the districts into surveys; the appointment of officers; and the assignment of compensations; have likewise been carried into effect. In a manner in which both materials and experience were wanting to guide the calculation it will be readily conceived that there must have been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits prescribed by the law. It is hoped that the circumspection which has been used will be found in the result to have secured the last of the two objects; but it is probable that with a view to the first in some instances a revision of the provision will be found advisable. The impressions with which this law has been received by the community have been upon the whole such as were to be expected among enlightened and well-disposed citizens from the propriety and necessity of the measure. The novelty; however; of the tax in a considerable part of the United States and a misconception of some of its provisions have given occasion in particular places to some degree of discontent; but it is satisfactory to know that this disposition yields to proper explanations and more just apprehensions of the true nature of the law; and I entertain a full confidence that it will in all give way to motives which arise out of a just sense of duty and a virtuous regard to the public welfare. If there are any circumstances in the law which consistently with its main design may be so varied as to remove any well-intentioned objections that may happen to exist; it will consist with a wise moderation to make the proper variations. It is desirable on all occasions to unite with a steady and firm adherence to constitutional and necessary acts of Government the fullest evidence of a disposition as far as may be practicable to consult the wishes of every part of the community and to lay the foundations of the public administration in the affections of the people. Pursuant to the authority contained in the several acts on that subject; a district of 10 miles square for the permanent seat of the Government of the United States has been fixed and announced by proclamation; which district will comprehend lands on both sides of the river Potomac and the towns of Alexandria and Georgetown. A city has also been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed before Congress; and as there is a prospect; favored by the rate of sales which have already taken place; of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public buildings; there is every expectation of their due progress. The completion of the census of the inhabitants; for which provision was made by law; has been duly notified (excepting one instance in which the return has been informal; and another in which it has been omitted or miscarried); and the returns of the officers who were charged with this duty; which will be laid before you; will give you the pleasing assurance that the present population of the United States borders on 4;000;000 persons. It is proper also to inform you that a further loan of 2;500;000 florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are similar to those of the one last announced; except as to a small reduction of charges. Another; on like terms; for 6;000;000 florins; had been set on foot under circumstances that assured an immediate completion. Gentlemen of the Senate: Two treaties which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees and Six Nations of Indians will be laid before you for your consideration and ratification. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: In entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust you must anticipate with pleasure that many of the difficulties necessarily incident to the first arrangements of a new government for an extensive country have been happily surmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your predecessors in cooperation with the other branch of the Legislature. The important objects which remain to be accomplished will; I am persuaded; be conducted upon principles equally comprehensive and equally well calculated of the advancement of the general weal. The time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the act making provision for the debt of the United States having expired; statements from the proper department will as soon as possible apprise you of the exact result. Enough; however; is known already to afford an assurance that the views of that act have been substantially fulfilled. The subscription in the domestic debt of the United States has embraced by far the greatest proportion of that debt; affording at the same time proof of the general satisfaction of the public creditors with the system which has been proposed to their acceptance and of the spirit of accommodation to the convenience of the Government with which they are actuated. The subscriptions in the debts of the respective States as far as the provisions of the law have permitted may be said to be yet more general. The part of the debt of the United States which remains unsubscribed will naturally engage your further deliberations. It is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you that the revenues which have been established promise to be adequate to their objects; and may be permitted; if no unforeseen exigency occurs; to supersede for the present the necessity of any new burthens upon our constituents. An object which will claim your early attention is a provision for the current service of the ensuing year; together with such ascertained demands upon the Treasury as require to be immediately discharged; and such casualties as may have arisen in the execution of the public business; for which no specific appropriation may have yet been made; of all which a proper estimate will be laid before you. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: I shall content myself with a general reference to former communications for several objects upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto postponed any definitive resolution. Their importance will recall them to your attention; and I trust that the progress already made in the most arduous arrangements of the Government will afford you leisure to resume them to advantage. These are; however; some of them of which I can not forbear a more particular mention. These are the militia; the post office and post roads; the mint; weights and measures; a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States. The first is certainly an object of primary importance whether viewed in reference to the national security to the satisfaction of the community or to the preservation of order. In connection with this the establishment of competent magazines and arsenals and the fortification of such places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable naturally present themselves to consideration. The safety of the United States under divine protection ought to rest on the basis of systematic and solid arrangements; exposed as little as possible to the hazards of fortuitous circumstances. The importance of the post office and post roads on a plan sufficiently liberal and comprehensive; as they respect the expedition; safety; and facility of communication; is increased by their instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the Government; which; while it contributes to the security of the people; serves also to guard them against the effects of misrepresentation and misconception. The establishment of additional cross posts; especially to some of the important points in the Western and Northern parts of the Union; can not fail to be of material utility. The disorders in the existing currency; and especially the scarcity of small change; a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes; strongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already entered into concerning the establishment of a mint. Measures have been taken pursuant to that resolution for procuring some of the most necessary artists; together with the requisite apparatus. An uniformity in the weights and measures of the country is among the important objects submitted to you by the Constitution; and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal; must be no less honorable to the public councils than conducive to the public convenience. A provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is particularly urged; among other reasons; by the important considerations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt; that if timely and judiciously applied they may save the necessity of burthening our citizens with new taxes for the extinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge the principal but in a limited proportion; no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the public of its right.

George Washington, November-6-1792, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-George-Washington-November-6-1792, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsGeorge-Washington-November-6-1792-speech, Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: It is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that; in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally; I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our Northwestern frontier have terminated. You will; I am persuaded; learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavors toward effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier; to stop the further effusion of blood; to arrest the progress of expense; to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes; in making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event; or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire; than the wish to find the object attainable; or if not attainable; to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case. A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences; which will be laid before you; while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far; will; I trust; evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them; indeed; is still depending; but a favorable one; though not to be despaired of; is not promised by anything that has yet happened. In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace. It will; I presume; be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality toward the families of the deceased. It must add to your concern to be informed that; besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio; some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it. A part of the Cherokees; known by the name of Chickamaugas; inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River; have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighboring settlements. It was hoped that the treaty of Holston; made with the Cherokee Nation in July; 1791; would have prevented a repetition of such depredations; but the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamaugas; aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity; have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been strictly enjoined and observed. It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter. I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited; though the number is still incomplete; and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing toward a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised; and some other points which have been suggested; will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations; and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable. In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This; however; will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostility. I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory. To enable; by competent rewards; the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighborhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion; its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable. The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated. This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessening in local extent; and; as applied to the community at large; the contentment with the law appears to be progressive. But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable; and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question; and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto. Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders; and Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens. I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the Supreme Court; which will be laid before you; points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations arise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject; provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the Constitution and laws of the Union and of the punishment for such offenses will; it is presumed; be found worthy of particular attention. Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise; however; by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it; and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations; and other infractions of the law of nations; which; furnishing just subject of complaint; might endanger our peace with them; and; in general; the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose; which takes place; if not renewed; at the close of the present session. In execution of the authority given by the Legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint. Others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings; and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them. The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage; as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns; will; I doubt not; be resumed and completed. It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the post office operate; in experiment; against the transmission of news papers to distant parts of the country. Should this; upon due inquiry; be found to be the fact; a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will; I doubt not; lead to the application of a remedy. The adoption of a constitution for the State of Kentucky has been notified to me. The Legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order. It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject; and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof; three new loans have been effected; each for 3;000;000 florinsâ€”one at Antwerp; at the annual interest of 4.5%; with an allowance of 4% in lieu of all charges; in the other 2 at Amsterdam; at the annual interest of 4%; with an allowance of 5.5% in one case and of 5% in the other in lieu of all charges. The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad. Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied; the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers; according to the provision made during the last session; has been embraced. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt; according to the right which has been reserved to the Government. No measure can be more desirable; whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation. Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States; pursuant to the eleventh section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made. Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand; and I doubt not will engage; your early attention. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects; not particularized in my present; as have been suggested in my former communications to you. Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these; that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice. The results of your common deliberations hitherto will; I trust; be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as; by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage; will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment to that Constitution of Government upon which; under Divine Providence; materially depend their union; their safety; and their happiness. Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony; combined with a due regard to stability; in the public councils. GO. WASHINGTON
George Washington, December-8-1795, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-George-Washington-December-8-1795, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsGeorge-Washington-December-8-1795-speech, Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: I trust I do not deceive myself when I indulge the persuasion that I have never met you at any period when more than at the present the situation of our public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual congratulation; and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we enjoy. The termination of the long; expensive; and distressing war in which we have been engaged with certain Indians northwest of the Ohio is placed in the option of the United States by a treaty which the commander of our army has concluded provisionally with the hostile tribes in that region. In the adjustment of the terms the satisfaction of the Indians was deemed worthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of the United States as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity. The object; it is believed; has been fully attained. The articles agreed upon will immediately be laid before the Senate for their consideration. The Creek and Cherokee Indians; who alone of the Southern tribes had annoyed our frontiers; have lately confirmed their preexisting treaties with us; and were giving evidence of a sincere disposition to carry them into effect by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had taken. But we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has been once more clouded by wanton murders; which some citizens of Georgia are represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks; which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger; which will be productive of further expense; and may occasion more effusion of blood. Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences of such outrages; and with the hope of their succeeding at least to avert general hostility. A letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our treaty made with his father; the late Emperor; and consequently the continuance of peace with that power. With peculiar satisfaction I add that information has been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers importing that the terms of the treaty with the Dey and Regency of that country had been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace and the restoration of our unfortunate fellow citizens from a grievous captivity. The latest advices from our envoy at the Court of Madrid give; moreover; the pleasing information that he had assurances of a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of his negotiation. While the event depending upon unadjusted particulars can not be regarded as ascertained; it is agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which; securing amicably very essential interests of the United States; will at the same time lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship we have uniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate. Though not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives; you; gentlemen; are all apprised that a treaty of amity; commerce; and navigation has been negotiated with Great Britain; and that the Senate have advised and consented to its ratification upon a condition which excepts part of one article. Agreeably thereto; and to the best judgment I was able to form of the public interest after full and mature deliberation; I have added my sanction. The result on the part of His Britannic Majesty is unknown. When received; the subject will without delay be placed before Congress. This interesting summary of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted; and with regard also to those of our Indian neighbors with whom we have been in a state of enmity or misunderstanding; opens a wide field for consoling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every side the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity; on terms compatible with our national rights and honor; shall be the happy result; how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accelerating; maturing; and establishing the prosperity of our country. Contemplating the internal situation as well as the external relations of the United States; we discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe; with their American dependencies; have been involved in a contest unusually bloody; exhausting; and calamitous; in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by domestic convulsion and insurrection; in which many of the arts most useful to society have been exposed to discouragement and decay; in which scarcity of subsistence has imbittered other sufferings; while even the anticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and repose are alloyed by the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens; which press upon all the departments of industry and threaten to clog the future springs of government; our favored country; happy in a striking contrast; has enjoyed tranquillityâ€”a tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintained at the expense of no duty. Faithful to ourselves; we have violated no obligation to others. Our agriculture; commerce; and manufactures prosper beyond former example; the molestations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which; however; very pointed remonstrances have been made) being overbalanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position. Our population advances with a celerity which; exceeding the most sanguine calculations; proportionally augments our strength and resources; and guarantees our future security. Every part of the Union displays indications of rapid and various improvement; and with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived; with resources fully adequate to our present exigencies; with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty; and with mild and wholesome laws; is it too much to say that our country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed; if ever before equaled? Placed in a situation every way so auspicious; motives of commanding force impel us; with sincere acknowledgment to Heaven and pure love to our country; to unite our efforts to preserve; prolong; and improve our immense advantages. To cooperate with you in this desirable work is a fervent and favorite wish of my heart. It is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare that the part of our country which was lately the scene of disorder and insurrection now enjoys the blessings of quiet and order. The misled have abandoned their errors; and pay the respect to our Constitution and laws which is due from good citizens to the public authorities of the society. These circumstances have induced me to pardon generally the offenders here referred to; and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to capital punishment. For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am vested; yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice; dignity; and safety may permit. Gentlemen: Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course of the session; a review of our military establishment is not the least important. It is called for by the events which have changed; and may be expected still further to change; the relative situation of our frontiers. In this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the considerations that the questions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet finally adjusted; that the war in Europe is not yet terminated; and that our Western posts; when recovered; will demand provision for garrisoning and securing them. A statement of our present military force will be laid before you by the Department of War. With the review of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of the militia. It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan further experience may have unfolded. The subject is of so much moment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the consideration of it may be renewed until the greatest attainable perfection shall be accomplished. Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object; while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public councils. While we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our Western borders so well authorizes; it is necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth which continually receives new confirmations; namely; that the provisions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants are insufficient. It is demonstrated that these violences can now be perpetrated with impunity; and it can need no argument to prove that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained by bringing the murderers to condign punishment; all the exertions of the Government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians will prove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospects illusory. The frequent destruction of innocent women and children; who are chiefly the victims of retaliation; must continue to shock humanity; and an enormous expense to drain the Treasury of the Union. To enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is indispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering justice to them. If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress; and especially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians on reasonable terms (a measure the mention of which I the more readily repeat; as in all the conferences with them they urge it with solicitude); I should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent. I add with pleasure that the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been thus far made under the auspices of Government. The accomplishment of this work; if practicable; will reflect undecaying luster on our national character and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The state of our revenue; with the sums which have been borrowed and reimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress; will be submitted from the proper Department; together with an estimate of the appropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year. Whether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the redemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination. Congress have demonstrated their sense to be; and it were superfluous to repeat mine; that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest of our country as with the general sense of our constituents. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further legislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely into effect; and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular quarters. The progress in providing materials for the frigates and in building them; the state of the fortifications of our harbors; the measures which have been pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals and for replenishing our magazines with military stores; and the steps which have been taken toward the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians will likewise be presented for the information of Congress. Temperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the course of the session and mutual forbearance where there is a difference of opinion are too obvious and necessary for the peace; happiness; and welfare of our country to need any recommendation of mine. GO. WASHINGTON
John Adams, November-22-1797, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-John-Adams-November-22-1797, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsJohn-Adams-November-22-1797-speech, Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary; on account of the contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia; to convene the National Legislature at some other place. This measure it was desirable to avoid; because it would occasion much public inconvenience and a considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants of this city; whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their fellow citizens. Therefore; after taking measures to ascertain the state and decline of the sickness; I postponed my determination; having hopes; now happily realized; that; without hazard to the lives or health of the members; Congress might assemble at this place; where it was next by law to meet. I submit; however; to your consideration whether a power to postpone the meeting of Congress; without passing the time fixed by the Constitution upon such occasions; would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794. Although I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in Europe and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our citizens from injustice and violence at sea; we have; nevertheless; abundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for interior tranquillity and personal security; for propitious seasons; prosperous agriculture; productive fisheries; and general improvements; and; above all; for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a calm but steady determination to support our sovereignty; as well as our moral and our religious principles; against all open and secret attacks. Our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarkedâ€”one in July; the other in Augustâ€”to join their colleague in Holland. I have received intelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland; from whence they all proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the 19th of September. Whatever may be the result of this mission; I trust that nothing will have been omitted on my part to conduct the negotiation to a successful conclusion; on such equitable terms as may be compatible with the safety; honor and interest of the United States. Nothing; in the mean time; will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of which on many former occasions the people of the United States have given such memorable proofs; and the exertion of those resources for national defense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within their power. It may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since the adjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary measures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at the opening of your late extraordinary session. If that system was then prudent; it is more so now; as increasing depredations strengthen the reasons for its adoption. Indeed; whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France; and whether the war in Europe is or is not to continue; I hold it most certain that permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained. The state of society has so long been disturbed; the sense of moral and religious obligations so much weakened; public faith and national honor have been so impaired; respect to treaties has been so diminished; and the law of nations has lost so much of its force; while pride; ambition; avarice and violence have been so long unrestrained; there remains no reasonable ground on which to raise an expectation that a commerce without protection or defense will not be plundered. The commerce of the United States is essential; if not to their existence; at least to their comfort; their growth; prosperity; and happiness. The genius; character; and habits of the people are highly commercial. Their cities have been formed and exist upon commerce. Our agriculture; fisheries; arts; and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it. In short; commerce has made this country what it is; and it can not be destroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty and distress. Great numbers are directly and solely supported by navigation. The faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of commercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens. Under this view of our affairs; I should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if I forbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect our commerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of defense as the only sure means of preserving both. I have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power at the opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable information of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty respecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the demarcation of the line of limits; but by the latest authentic intelligence Spanish garrisons were still continued within our country; and the running of the boundary line had not been commenced. These circumstances are the more to be regretted as they can not fail to affect the Indians in a manner injurious to the United States. Still; however; indulging the hope that the answers which have been given will remove the objections offered by the Spanish officers to the immediate execution of the treaty; I have judged it proper that we should continue in readiness to receive the posts and to run the line of limits. Further information on this subject will be communicated in the course of the session. In connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontier it is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienate the affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actual hostilities against the United States. Great activity has been exerted by those persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribes residing within the territory of the United States to influence them to transfer their affections and force to a foreign nation; to form them into a confederacy; and prepare them for war against the United States. Although measures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights; to prevent Indian hostilities; and to preserve entire their attachment to the United States; it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect to these measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of such practices a law providing adequate punishment for such offenses may be necessary. The commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the treaty of amity; commerce; and navigation between the United States and Great Britain to ascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace; met at Passamaquoddy Bay in 1796 October; and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question and the adjacent shores and islands; and; being of opinion that actual surveys of both rivers to their sources were necessary; gave to the agents of the two nations instructions for that purpose; and adjourned to meet at Boston in August. They met; but the surveys requiring more time than had been supposed; and not being then completed; the commissioners again adjourned; to meet at Providence; in the State of Rhode Island; in June next; when we may expect a final examination and decision. The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 6th article of the treaty met at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjects for debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them from citizens or inhabitants of the United States. Various causes have hitherto prevented any determinations; but the business is now resumed; and doubtless will be prosecuted without interruption. Several decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses and damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or condemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by the commissioners in London conformably to the 7th article of the treaty. The sums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the British Government. A considerable number of other claims; where costs and damages; and not captured property; were the only objects in question; have been decided by arbitration; and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States have also been paid. The commissioners appointed agreeably to the 21st article of our treaty with Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide on the claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between Spain and France. Their sittings have been interrupted; but are now resumed. The United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects; upon the award of the commissioners acting under the 6th article of the treaty with Great Britain; and for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects by reason of the capture of their vessels and merchandise taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States and brought into their ports; or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the United States; upon the awards of the commissioners acting under the 7th article of the same treaty; it is necessary that provision be made for fulfilling these obligations. The numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French Republic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerable expenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before their tribunals. The sums required for this purpose have in divers instances been disbursed by the consuls of the United States. By means of the same captures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreign countries; destitute of all means of subsistence; and the sick in particular have been exposed to grievous sufferings. The consuls have in these cases also advanced moneys for their relief. For these advances they reasonably expect reimbursements from the United States. The consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment. The provisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return are found to be inadequate and ineffectual. Another provision seems necessary to be added to the consular act. Some foreign vessels have been discovered sailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers. It seldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception; because they have no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sea letters. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: It is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objects which by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphereâ€”the national debts and taxes. Since the decay of the feudal system; by which the public defense was provided for chiefly at the expense of individuals; the system of loans has been introduced; and as no nation can raise within the year by taxes sufficient sums for its defense and military operations in time of war the sums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the subjects of what have been called funding systems. The consequences arising from the continual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish us to be careful to prevent their growth in our own. The national defense must be provided for as well as the support of Government; but both should be accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes; and as little as possible by loans. The estimates for the service of the ensuing year will by my direction be laid before you. Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: We are met together at a most interesting period. The situations of the principal powers of Europe are singular and portentous. Connected with some by treaties and with all by commerce; no important event there can be indifferent to us. Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity not less for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor; safety; and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions of wisdom and firmness. In all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.
Franklin Roosevelt, January-3-1936, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-Franklin-D-Roosevelt-January-3-1936, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsFranklin-Roosevelt-January-3-1936-speech," Mr. President; Mr. Speaker; Members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: We are about to enter upon another year of the responsibility which the electorate of the United States has placed in our hands. Having come so far; it is fitting that we should pause to survey the ground which we have covered and the path which lies ahead. On the fourth day of March; 1933; on the occasion of taking the oath of office as President of the United States; I addressed the people of our country. Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion? The crisis of that moment was almost exclusively a national one. In recognition of that fact; so obvious to the millions in the streets and in the homes of America; I devoted by far the greater part of that address to what I called; and the Nation called; critical days within our own borders. You will remember that on that fourth of March; 1933; the world picture was an image of substantial peace. International consultation and widespread hope for the bettering of relations between the Nations gave to all of us a reasonable expectation that the barriers to mutual confidence; to increased trade; and to the peaceful settlement of disputes could be progressively removed. In fact; my only reference to the field of world policy in that address was in these words: ""I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighborâ€”the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and; because he does so; respects the rights of othersâ€”a neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors."" In the years that have followed; that sentiment has remained the dedication of this Nation. Among the Nations of the great Western Hemisphere the policy of the good neighbor has happily prevailed. At no time in the four and a half centuries of modern civilization in the Americas has there existedâ€”in any year; in any decade; in any generation in all that timeâ€”a greater spirit of mutual understanding; of common helpfulness; and of devotion to the ideals of serf-government than exists today in the twenty-one American Republics and their neighbor; the Dominion of Canada. This policy of the good neighbor among the Americas is no longer a hope; no longer an objective remaining to be accomplished. It is a fact; active; present; pertinent and effective. In this achievement; every American Nation takes an understanding part. There is neither war; nor rumor of war; nor desire for war. The inhabitants of this vast area; two hundred and fifty million strong; spreading more than eight thousand miles from the Arctic to the Antarctic; believe in; and propose to follow; the policy of the good neighbor. They wish with all their heart that the rest of the world might do likewise. The rest of the worldâ€”Ah! there is the rub. Were I today to deliver an Inaugural Address to the people of the United States; I could not limit my comments on world affairs to one paragraph. With much regret I should be compelled to devote the greater part to world affairs. Since the summer of that same year of 1933; the temper and the purposes of the rulers of many of the great populations in Europe and in Asia have not pointed the way either to peace or to good-will among men. Not only have peace and good-will among men grown more remote in those areas of the earth during this period; but a point has been reached where the people of the Americas must take cognizance of growing ill-will; of marked trends toward aggression; of increasing armaments; of shortening tempersâ€”a situation which has in it many of the elements that lead to the tragedy of general war. On those other continents many Nations; principally the smaller peoples; if left to themselves; would be content with their boundaries and willing to solve within themselves and in cooperation with their neighbors their individual problems; both economic and social. The rulers of those Nations; deep in their hearts; follow these peaceful and reasonable aspirations of their peoples. These rulers must remain ever vigilant against the possibility today or tomorrow of invasion or attack by the rulers of other peoples who fail to subscribe to the principles of bettering the human race by peaceful means. Within those other Nationsâ€”those which today must bear the primary; definite responsibility for jeopardizing world peaceâ€”what hope lies? To say the least; there are grounds for pessimism. It is idle for us or for others to preach that the masses of the people who constitute those Nations which are dominated by the twin spirits of autocracy and aggression; are out of sympathy with their rulers; that they are allowed no opportunity to express themselves; that they would change things if they could. That; unfortunately; is not so clear. It might be true that the masses of the people in those Nations would change the policies of their Governments if they could be allowed full freedom and full access to the processes of democratic government as we understand them. But they do not have that access; lacking it they follow blindly and fervently the lead of those who seek autocratic power. Nations seeking expansion; seeking the rectification of injustices springing from former wars; or seeking outlets for trade; for population or even for their own peaceful contributions to the progress of civilization; fail to demonstrate that patience necessary to attain reasonable and legitimate objectives by peaceful negotiation or by an appeal to the finer instincts of world justice. They have therefore impatiently reverted to the old belief in the law of the sword; or to the fantastic conception that they; and they alone; are chosen to fulfill a mission and that all the others among the billion and a half of human beings in the world must and shall learn from and be subject to them. I recognize and you will recognize that these words which I have chosen with deliberation will not prove popular in any Nation that chooses to fit this shoe to its foot. Such sentiments; however; will find sympathy and understanding in those Nations where the people themselves are honestly desirous of peace but must constantly align themselves on one side or the other in the kaleidoscopic jockeying for position which is characteristic of European and Asiatic relations today. For the peace-loving Nations; and there are many of them; find that their very identity depends on their moving and moving again on the chess board of international politics. I suggested in the spring of 1933 that 85 or 90 percent of all the people in the world were content with the territorial limits of their respective Nations and were willing further to reduce their armed forces if every other Nation in the world would agree to do likewise. That is equally true today; and it is even more true today that world peace and world good-will are blocked by only 10 or 15 percent of the world's population. That is why efforts to reduce armies have thus far not only failed; but have been met by vastly increased armaments on land and in the air. That is why even efforts to continue the existing limits on naval armaments into the years to come show such little current success. But the policy of the United States has been clear and consistent. We have sought with earnestness in every possible way to limit world armaments and to attain the peaceful solution of disputes among all Nations. We have sought by every legitimate means to exert our moral influence against repression; against intolerance; against autocracy and in favor of freedom of expression; equality before the law; religious tolerance and popular rule. In the field of commerce we have undertaken to encourage a more reasonable interchange of the world's goods. In the field of international finance we have; so far as we are concerned; put an end to dollar diplomacy; to money grabbing; to speculation for the benefit of the powerful and the rich; at the expense of the small and the poor. As a consistent part of a clear policy; the United States is following a twofold neutrality toward any and all Nations which engage in wars that are not of immediate concern to the Americas. First; we decline to encourage the prosecution of war by permitting belligerents to obtain arms; ammunition or implements of war from the United States. Second; we seek to discourage the use by belligerent Nations of any and all American products calculated to facilitate the prosecution of a war in quantities over and above our normal exports of them in time of peace. I trust that these objectives thus clearly and unequivocally stated will be carried forward by cooperation between this Congress and the President. I realize that I have emphasized to you the gravity of the situation which confronts the people of the world. This emphasis is justified because of its importance to civilization and therefore to the United States. Peace is jeopardized by the few and not by the many. Peace is threatened by those who seek selfish power. The world has witnessed similar erasâ€”as in the days when petty kings and feudal barons were changing the map of Europe every fortnight; or when great emperors and great kings were engaged in a mad scramble for colonial empire. We hope that we are not again at the threshold of such an era. But if face it we must; then the United States and the rest of the Americas can play but one role: through a well-ordered neutrality to do naught to encourage the contest; through adequate defense to save ourselves from embroilment and attack; and through example and all legitimate encouragement and assistance to persuade other Nations to return to the ways of peace and good-will. The evidence before us clearly proves that autocracy in world affairs endangers peace and that such threats do not spring from those Nations devoted to the democratic ideal. If this be true in world affairs; it should have the greatest weight in the determination of domestic policies. Within democratic Nations the chief concern of the people is to prevent the continuance or the rise of autocratic institutions that beget slavery at home and aggression abroad. Within our borders; as in the world at large; popular opinion is at war with a power-seeking minority. That is no new thing. It was fought out in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. From time to time since then; the battle has been continued; under Thomas Jefferson; Andrew Jackson; Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. In these latter years we have witnessed the domination of government by financial and industrial groups; numerically small but politically dominant in the twelve years that succeeded the World War. The present group of which I speak is indeed numerically small and; while it exercises a large influence and has much to say in the world of business; it does not; I am confident; speak the true sentiments of the less articulate but more important elements that constitute real American business. In March; 1933; I appealed to the Congress of the United States and to the people of the United States in a new effort to restore power to those to whom it rightfully belonged. The response to that appeal resulted in the writing of a new chapter in the history of popular government. You; the members of the Legislative branch; and I; the Executive; contended for and established a new relationship between Government and people. What were the terms of that new relationship? They were an appeal from the clamor of many private and selfish interests; yes; an appeal from the clamor of partisan interest; to the ideal of the public interest. Government became the representative and the trustee of the public interest. Our aim was to build upon essentially democratic institutions; seeking all the while the adjustment of burdens; the help of the needy; the protection of the weak; the liberation of the exploited and the genuine protection of the people's property. It goes without saying that to create such an economic constitutional order; more than a single legislative enactment was called for. We; you in the Congress and I as the Executive; had to build upon a broad base. Now; after thirty-four months of work; we contemplate a fairly rounded whole. We have returned the control of the Federal Government to the City of Washington. To be sure; in so doing; we have invited battle. We have earned the hatred of entrenched greed. The very nature of the problem that we faced made it necessary to drive some people from power and strictly to regulate others. I made that plain when I took the oath of office in March; 1933. I spoke of the practices of the unscrupulous money-changers who stood indicted in the court of public opinion. I spoke of the rulers of the exchanges of mankind's goods; who failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence. I said that they had admitted their failure and had abdicated. Abdicated? Yes; in 1933; but now with the passing of danger they forget their damaging admissions and withdraw their abdication. They seek the restoration of their selfish power. They offer to lead us back round the same old corner into the same old dreary street. Yes; there are still determined groups that are intent upon that very thing. Rigorously held up to popular examination; their true character presents itself. They steal the livery of great national constitutional ideals to serve discredited special interests. As guardians and trustees for great groups of individual stockholders they wrongfully seek to carry the property and the interests entrusted to them into the arena of partisan politics. They seekâ€”this minority in business and industryâ€”to control and often do control and use for their own purposes legitimate and highly honored business associations; they engage in vast propaganda to spread fear and discord among the peopleâ€”they would ""gang up"" against the people's liberties. The principle that they would instill into government if they succeed in seizing power is well shown by the principles which many of them have instilled into their own affairs: autocracy toward labor; toward stockholders; toward consumers; toward public sentiment. Autocrats in smaller things; they seek autocracy in bigger things. ""By their fruits ye shall know them."" If these gentlemen believe; as they say they believe; that the measures adopted by this Congress and its predecessor; and carried out by this Administration; have hindered rather than promoted recovery; let them be consistent. Let them propose to this Congress the complete repeal of these measures. The way is open to such a proposal. Let action be positive and not negative. The way is open in the Congress of the United States for an expression of opinion by yeas and nays. Shall we say that values are restored and that the Congress will; therefore; repeal the laws under which we have been bringing them back? Shall we say that because national income has grown with rising prosperity; we shall repeal existing taxes and thereby put off the day of approaching a balanced budget and of starting to reduce the national debt? Shall we abandon the reasonable support and regulation of banking? Shall we restore the dollar to its former gold content? Shall we say to the farmer; ""The prices for your products are in part restored. Now go and hoe your own row?"" Shall we say to the home owners; ""We have reduced your rates of interest. We have no further concern with how you keep your home or what you pay for your money. That is your affair?"" Shall we say to the several millions of unemployed citizens who face the very problem of existence; of getting enough to eat; ""We will withdraw from giving you work. We will turn you back to the charity of your communities and those men of selfish power who tell you that perhaps they will employ you if the Government leaves them strictly alone?"" Shall we say to the needy unemployed; ""Your problem is a local one except that perhaps the Federal Government; as an act of mere generosity; will be willing to pay to your city or to your county a few grudging dollars to help maintain your soup kitchens?"" Shall we say to the children who have worked all day in the factories; ""Child labor is a local issue and so are your starvation wages; something to be solved or left unsolved by the jurisdiction of forty-eight States?"" Shall we say to the laborer; ""Your right to organize; your relations with your employer have nothing to do with the public interest; if your employer will not even meet with you to discuss your problems and his; that is none of our affair?"" Shall we say to the unemployed and the aged; ""Social security lies not within the province of the Federal Government; you must seek relief elsewhere?"" Shall we say to the men and women who live in conditions of squalor in country and in city; ""The health and the happiness of you and your children are no concern of ours?"" Shall we expose our population once more by the repeal of laws which protect them against the loss of their honest investments and against the manipulations of dishonest speculators? Shall we abandon the splendid efforts of the Federal Government to raise the health standards of the Nation and to give youth a decent opportunity through such means as the Civilian Conservation Corps? Members of the Congress; let these challenges be met. If this is what these gentlemen want; let them say so to the Congress of the United States. Let them no longer hide their dissent in a cowardly cloak of generality. Let them define the issue. We have been specific in our affirmative action. Let them be specific in their negative attack. But the challenge faced by this Congress is more menacing than merely a return to the pastâ€”bad as that would be. Our resplendent economic autocracy does not want to return to that individualism of which they prate; even though the advantages under that system went to the ruthless and the strong. They realize that in thirty-four months we have built up new instruments of public power. In the hands of a people's Government this power is wholesome and proper. But in the hands of political puppets of an economic autocracy such power would provide shackles for the liberties of the people. Give them their way and they will take the course of every autocracy of the pastâ€”power for themselves; enslavement for the public. Their weapon is the weapon of fear. I have said; ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" That is as true today as it was in 1933. But such fear as they instill today is not a natural fear; a normal fear; it is a synthetic; manufactured; poisonous fear that is being spread subtly; expensively and cleverly by the same people who cried in those other days; ""Save us; save us; lest we perish."" I am confident that the Congress of the United States well understands the facts and is ready to wage unceasing warfare against those who seek a continuation of that spirit of fear. The carrying out of the laws of the land as enacted by the Congress requires protection until final adjudication by the highest tribunal of the land. The Congress has the right and can find the means to protect its own prerogatives. We are justified in our present confidence. Restoration of national income; which shows continuing gains for the third successive year; supports the normal and logical policies under which agriculture and industry are returning to full activity. Under these policies we approach a balance of the national budget. National income increases; tax receipts; based on that income; increase without the levying of new taxes. That is why I am able to say to this; the Second Session of the 74th Congress; that it is my belief based on existing laws that no new taxes; over and above the present taxes; are either advisable or necessary. National income increases; employment increases. Therefore; we can look forward to a reduction in the number of those citizens who are in need. Therefore; also; we can anticipate a reduction in our appropriations for relief. In the light of our substantial material progress; in the light of the increasing effectiveness of the restoration of popular rule; I recommend to the Congress that we advance; that we do not retreat. I have confidence that you will not fail the people of the Nation whose mandate you have already so faithfully fulfilled. I repeat; with the same faith and the same determination; my words of March 4; 1933: ""We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with a clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with a clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life. We do not distrust the future of essential democracy."" I cannot better end this message on the state of the Union than by repeating the words of a wise philosopher at whose feet I sat many; many years ago. ""What great crises teach all men whom the example and counsel of the brave inspire is the lesson: Fear not; view all the tasks of life as sacred; have faith in the triumph of the ideal; give daily all that you have to give; be loyal and rejoice whenever you find yourselves part of a great ideal enterprise. You; at this moment; have the honor to belong to a generation whose lips are touched by fire. You live in a land that now enjoys the blessings of peace. But let nothing human be wholly alien to you. The human race now passes through one of its great crises. New ideas; new issuesâ€”a new call for men to carry on the work of righteousness; of charity; of courage; of patience; and of loyalty. . . . However memory bring back this moment to your minds; let it be able to say to you: That was a great moment. It was the beginning of a new era. . . . This world in its crisis called for volunteers; for men of faith in life; of patience in service; of charity and of insight. I responded to the call however I could. I volunteered to give myself to my Masterâ€”the cause of humane and brave living. I studied; I loved; I labored; unsparingly and hopefully; to be worthy of my generation."""
Franklin Roosevelt, January-6-1937, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-Franklin-D-Roosevelt-January-6-1937, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsFranklin-Roosevelt-January-6-1937-speech," Mr. President; Mr. Speaker; Members of the Congress of the United States: For the first time in our national history a President delivers his Annual Message to a new Congress within a fortnight of the expiration of his term of office. While there is no change in the Presidency this year; change will occur in future years. It is my belief that under this new constitutional practice; the President should in every fourth year; in so far as seems reasonable; review the existing state of our national affairs and outline broad future problems; leaving specific recommendations for future legislation to be made by the President about to be inaugurated. At this time; however; circumstances of the moment compel me to ask your immediate consideration of: First; measures extending the life of certain authorizations and powers which; under present statutes; expire within a few weeks; second; an addition to the existing Neutrality Act to cover specific points raised by the unfortunate civil strife in Spain; and; third; a deficiency appropriation bill for which I shall submit estimates this week. In March; 1933; the problems which faced our Nation and which only our national Government had the resources to meet were more serious even than appeared on the surface. It was not only that the visible mechanism of economic life had broken down. More disturbing was the fact that long neglect of the needs of the underprivileged had brought too many of our people to the verge of doubt as to the successful adaptation of our historic traditions to the complex modern world. In that lay a challenge to our democratic form of Government itself. Ours was the task to prove that democracy could be made to function in the world of today as effectively as in the simpler world of a hundred years ago. Ours was the task to do more than to argue a theory. The times required the confident answer of performance to those whose instinctive faith in humanity made them want to believe that in the long run democracy would prove superior to more extreme forms of Government as a process of getting action when action was wisdom; without the spiritual sacrifices which those other forms of Government exact. That challenge we met. To meet it required unprecedented activities under Federal leadership to end abuses; to restore a large measure of material prosperity; to give new faith to millions of our citizens who had been traditionally taught to expect that democracy would provide continuously wider opportunity and continuously greater security in a world where science was continuously making material riches more available to man. In the many methods of attack with which we met these problems; you and I; by mutual understanding and by determination to cooperate; helped to make democracy succeed by refusing to permit unnecessary disagreement to arise between two of our branches of Government. That spirit of cooperation was able to solve difficulties of extraordinary magnitude and ramification with few important errors; and at a cost cheap when measured by the immediate necessities and the eventual results. I look forward to a continuance of that cooperation in the next four years. I look forward also to a continuance of the basis of that cooperationâ€” mutual respect for each other's proper sphere of functioning in a democracy which is working well; and a common-sense realization of the need for play in the joints of the machine. On that basis; it is within the right of the Congress to determine which of the many new activities shall be continued or abandoned; increased or curtailed. On that same basis; the President alone has the responsibility for their administration. I find that this task of Executive management has reached the point where our administrative machinery needs comprehensive overhauling. I shall; therefore; shortly address the Congress more fully in regard to modernizing and improving the Executive branch of the Government. That cooperation of the past four years between the Congress and the President has aimed at the fulfillment of a twofold policy: first; economic recovery through many kinds of assistance to agriculture; industry and banking; and; second; deliberate improvement in the personal security and opportunity of the great mass of our people. The recovery we sought was not to be merely temporary. It was to be a recovery protected from the causes of previous disasters. With that aim in viewâ€”to prevent a future similar crisisâ€”you and I joined in a series of enactmentsâ€”safe banking and sound currency; the guarantee of bank deposits; protection for the investor in securities; the removal of the threat of agricultural surpluses; insistence on collective bargaining; the outlawing of sweat shops; child labor and unfair trade practices; and the beginnings of security for the aged and the worker. Nor was the recovery we sought merely a purposeless whirring of machinery. It is important; of course; that every man and woman in the country be able to find work; that every factory run; that business and farming as a whole earn profits. But Government in a democratic Nation does not exist solely; or even primarily; for that purpose. It is not enough that the wheels turn. They must carry us in the direction of a greater satisfaction in life for the average man. The deeper purpose of democratic government is to assist as many of its citizens as possible; especially those who need it most; to improve their conditions of life; to retain all personal liberty which does not adversely affect their neighbors; and to pursue the happiness which comes with security and an opportunity for recreation and culture. Even with our present recovery we are far from the goal of that deeper purpose. There are far-reaching problems still with us for which democracy must find solutions if it is to consider itself successful. For example; many millions of Americans still live in habitations which not only fail to provide the physical benefits of modern civilization but breed disease and impair the health of future generations. The menace exists not only in the slum areas of the very large cities; but in many smaller cities as well. It exists on tens of thousands of farms; in varying degrees; in every part of the country. Another example is the prevalence of an un-American type of tenant farming. I do not suggest that every farm family has the capacity to earn a satisfactory living on its own farm. But many thousands of tenant farmers; indeed most of them; with some financial assistance and with some advice and training; can be made self-supporting on land which can eventually belong to them. The Nation would be wise to offer them that chance instead of permitting them to go along as they do now; year after year; with neither future security as tenants nor hope of ownership of their homes nor expectation of bettering the lot of their children. Another national problem is the intelligent development of our social security system; the broadening of the services it renders; and practical improvement in its operation. In many Nations where such laws are in effect; success in meeting the expectations of the community has come through frequent amendment of the original statute. And; of course; the most far-reaching and the most inclusive problem of all is that of unemployment and the lack of economic balance of which unemployment is at once the result and the symptom. The immediate question of adequate relief for the needy unemployed who are capable of performing useful work; I shall discuss with the Congress during the coming months. The broader task of preventing unemployment is a matter of long-range evolutionary policy. To that we must continue to give our best thought and effort. We cannot assume that immediate industrial and commercial activity which mitigates present pressures justifies the national Government at this time in placing the unemployment problem in a filing cabinet of finished business. Fluctuations in employment are tied to all other wasteful fluctuations in our mechanism of production and distribution. One of these wastes is speculation. In securities or commodities; the larger the volume of speculation; the wider become the upward and downward swings and the more certain the result that in the long run there will be more losses than gains in the underlying wealth of the community. And; as is now well known to all of us; the same net loss to society comes from reckless overproduction and monopolistic underproduction of natural and manufactured commodities. Overproduction; underproduction and speculation are three evil sisters who distill the troubles of unsound inflation and disastrous deflation. It is to the interest of the Nation to have Government help private enterprise to gain sound general price levels and to protect those levels from wide perilous fluctuations. We know now that if early in 1931 Government had taken the steps which were taken two and three years later; the depression would never have reached the depths of the beginning of 1933. Sober second thought confirms most of us in the belief that the broad objectives of the National Recovery Act were sound. We know now that its difficulties arose from the fact that it tried to do too much. For example; it was unwise to expect the same agency to regulate the length of working hours; minimum wages; child labor and collective bargaining on the one hand and the complicated questions of unfair trade practices and business controls on the other. The statute of N.R.A. has been outlawed. The problems have not. They are still with us. That decent conditions and adequate pay for labor; and just return for agriculture; can be secured through parallel and simultaneous action by forty-eight States is a proven impossibility. It is equally impossible to obtain curbs on monopoly; unfair trade practices and speculation by State action alone. There are those who; sincerely or insincerely; still cling to State action as a theoretical hope. But experience with actualities makes it clear that Federal laws supplementing State laws are needed to help solve the problems which result from modern invention applied in an industrialized Nation which conducts its business with scant regard to State lines. During the past year there has been a growing belief that there is little fault to be found with the Constitution of the United States as it stands today. The vital need is not an alteration of our fundamental law; but an increasingly enlightened view with reference to it. Difficulties have grown out of its interpretation; but rightly considered; it can be used as an instrument of progress; and not as a device for prevention of action. It is worth our while to read and reread the preamble of the Constitution; and Article I thereof which confers the legislative powers upon the Congress of the United States. It is also worth our while to read again the debates in the Constitutional Convention of one hundred and fifty years ago. From such reading; I obtain the very definite thought that the members of that Convention were fully aware that civilization would raise problems for the proposed new Federal Government; which they themselves could not even surmise; and that it was their definite intent and expectation that a liberal interpretation in the years to come would give to the Congress the same relative powers over new national problems as they themselves gave to the Congress over the national problems of their day. In presenting to the Convention the first basic draft of the Constitution; Edmund Randolph explained that it was the purpose ""to insert essential principles only; lest the operation of government should be clogged by rendering those provisions permanent and unalterable which ought to be accommodated to times and events."" With a better understanding of our purposes; and a more intelligent recognition of our needs as a Nation; it is not to be assumed that there will be prolonged failure to bring legislative and judicial action into closer harmony. Means must be found to adapt our legal forms and our judicial interpretation to the actual present national needs of the largest progressive democracy in the modern world. That thought leads to a consideration of world problems. To go no further back than the beginning of this century; men and women everywhere were seeking conditions of life very different from those which were customary before modern invention and modern industry and modern communications had come into being. The World war; for all of its tragedy; encouraged these demands; and stimulated action to fulfill these new desires. Many national Governments seemed unable adequately to respond; and; often with the improvident assent of the masses of the people themselves; new forms of government were set up with oligarchy taking the place of democracy. In oligarchies; militarism has leapt forward; while in those Nations which have retained democracy; militarism has waned. I have recently visited three of our sister Republics in South America. The very cordial receptions with which I was greeted were in tribute to democracy. To me the outstanding observation of that visit was that the masses of the peoples of all the Americas are convinced that the democratic form of government can be made to succeed and do not wish to substitute for it any other form of government. They believe that democracies are best able to cope with the changing problems of modern civilization within themselves; and that democracies are best able to maintain peace among themselves. The Inter-American Conference; operating on these fundamental principles of democracy; did much to assure peace in this Hemisphere. Existing peace machinery was improved. New instruments to maintain peace and eliminate causes of war were adopted. Wider protection of the interests of the American Republics in the event of war outside the Western Hemisphere was provided. Respect for; and observance of; international treaties and international law were strengthened. Principles of liberal trade policies; as effective aids to the maintenance of peace; were reaffirmed. The intellectual and cultural relationships among American Republics were broadened as a part of the general peace program. In a world unhappily thinking in terms of war; the representatives of twenty-one Nations sat around a table; in an atmosphere of complete confidence and understanding; sincerely discussing measures for maintaining peace. Here was a great and a permanent achievement directly affecting the lives and security of the two hundred and fifty million human beings who dwell in this Western Hemisphere. Here was an example which must have a wholesome effect upon the rest of the world. In a very real sense; the Conference in Buenos Aires sent forth a message on behalf of all the democracies of the world to those Nations which live otherwise. Because such other Governments are perhaps more spectacular; it was high time for democracy to assert itself. Because all of us believe that our democratic form of government can cope adequately with modern problems as they arise; it is patriotic as well as logical for us to prove that we can meet new national needs with new laws consistent with an historic constitutional framework clearly intended to receive liberal and not narrow interpretation. The United States of America; within itself; must continue the task of making democracy succeed. In that task the Legislative branch of our Government will; I am confident; continue to meet the demands of democracy whether they relate to the curbing of abuses; the extension of help to those who need help; or the better balancing of our interdependent economies. So; too; the Executive branch of the Government must move forward in this task; and; at the same time; provide better management for administrative action of all kinds. The Judicial branch also is asked by the people to do its part in making democracy successful. We do not ask the Courts to call non-existent powers into being; but we have a right to expect that conceded powers or those legitimately implied shall be made effective instruments for the common good. The process of our democracy must not be imperiled by the denial of essential powers of free government. Your task and mine is not ending with the end of the depression. The people of the United States have made it clear that they expect us to continue our active efforts in behalf of their peaceful advancement. In that spirit of endeavor and service I greet the 75th Congress at the beginning of this auspicious New Year."
Franklin Roosevelt, January-4-1939, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-Franklin-D-Roosevelt-January-4-1939, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsFranklin-Roosevelt-January-4-1939-speech," Mr. Vice President; Mr. Speaker; Members of the Senate and the Congress: In Reporting on the state of the nation; I have felt it necessary on previous occasions to advise the Congress of disturbance abroad and of the need of putting our own house in order in the face of storm signals from across the seas. As this Seventy-sixth Congress opens there is need for further warning. A war which threatened to envelop the world in flames has been averted; but it has become increasingly clear that world peace is not assured. All about us rage undeclared warsâ€”military and economic. All about us grow more deadly armamentsâ€”military and economic. All about us are threats of new aggression military and economic. Storms from abroad directly challenge three institutions indispensable to Americans; now as always. The first is religion. It is the source of the other twoâ€”democracy and international good faith. Religion; by teaching man his relationship to God; gives the individual a sense of his own dignity and teaches him to respect himself by respecting his neighbors. Democracy; the practice of self-government; is a covenant among free men to respect the rights and liberties of their fellows. International good faith; a sister of democracy; springs from the will of civilized nations of men to respect the rights and liberties of other nations of men. In a modern civilization; all threeâ€”religion; democracy and international good faithâ€”complement and support each other. Where freedom of religion has been attacked; the attack has come from sources opposed to democracy. Where democracy has been overthrown; the spirit of free worship has disappeared. And where religion and democracy have vanished; good faith and reason in international affairs have given way to strident ambition and brute force. An ordering of society which relegates religion; democracy and good faith among nations to the background can find no place within it for the ideals of the Prince of Peace. The United States rejects such an ordering; and retains its ancient faith. There comes a time in the affairs of men when they must prepare to defend; not their homes alone; but the tenets of faith and humanity on which their churches; their governments and their very civilization are founded. The defense of religion; of democracy and of good faith among nations is all the same fight. To save one we must now make up our minds to save all. We know what might happen to us of the United States if the new philosophies of force were to encompass the other continents and invade our own. We; no more than other nations; can afford to be surrounded by the enemies of our faith and our humanity. Fortunate it is; therefore; that in this Western Hemisphere we have; under a common ideal of democratic government; a rich diversity of resources and of peoples functioning together in mutual respect and peace. That Hemisphere; that peace; and that ideal we propose to do our share in protecting against storms from any quarter. Our people and our resources are pledged to secure that protection. From that determination no American flinches. This by no means implies that the American Republics disassociate themselves from the nations of other continents. It does not mean the Americas against the rest of the world. We as one of the Republics reiterate our willingness to help the cause of world peace. We stand on our historic offer to take counsel with all other nations of the world to the end that aggression among them be terminated; that the race of armaments cease and that commerce be renewed. But the world has grown so small and weapons of attack so swift that no nation can be safe in its will to peace so long as any other powerful nation refuses to settle its grievances at the council table. For if any government bristling with implements of war insists on policies of force; weapons of defense give the only safety. In our foreign relations we have learned from the past what not to do. From new wars we have learned what we must do. We have learned that effective timing of defense; and the distant points from which attacks may be launched are completely different from what they were twenty years ago. We have learned that survival cannot be guaranteed by arming after the attack beginsâ€”for there is new range and speed to offense. We have learned that long before any overt military act; aggression begins with preliminaries of propaganda; subsidized penetration; the loosening of ties of good will; the stirring of prejudice and the incitement to disunion. We have learned that God-fearing democracies of the world which observe the sanctity of treaties and good faith in their dealings with other nations cannot safely be indifferent to international lawlessness anywhere. They cannot forever let pass; without effective protest; acts of aggression against sister nationsâ€”acts which automatically undermine all of us. Obviously they must proceed along practical; peaceful lines. But the mere fact that we rightly decline to intervene with arms to prevent acts of aggression does not mean that we must act as if there were no aggression at all. Words may be futile; but war is not the only means of commanding a decent respect for the opinions of mankind. There are many methods short of war; but stronger and more effective than mere words; of bringing home to aggressor governments the aggregate sentiments of our own people. At the very least; we can and should avoid any action; or any lack of action; which will encourage; assist or build up an aggressor. We have learned that when we deliberately try to legislate neutrality; our neutrality laws may operate unevenly and unfairlyâ€”may actually give aid to an aggressor and deny it to the victim. The instinct of self-preservation should warn us that we ought not to let that happen any more. And we have learned something elseâ€”the old; old lesson that probability of attack is mightily decreased by the assurance of an ever ready defense. Since 1931; nearly eight years ago; world events of thunderous import have moved with lightning speed. During these eight years many of our people clung to the hope that the innate decency of mankind would protect the unprepared who showed their innate trust in mankind. Today we are all wiserâ€”and sadder. Under modern conditions what we mean by ""adequate defense""â€”a policy subscribed to by all of usâ€”must be divided into three elements. First; we must have armed forces and defenses strong enough to ward off sudden attack against strategic positions and key facilities essential to ensure sustained resistance and ultimate victory. Secondly; we must have the organization and location of those key facilities so that they may be immediately utilized and rapidly expanded to meet all needs without danger of serious interruption by enemy attack. In the course of a few days I shall send you a special message making recommendations for those two essentials of defense against danger which we cannot safely assume will not come. If these first two essentials are reasonably provided for; we must be able confidently to invoke the third element; the underlying strength of citizenshipâ€”the self-confidence; the ability; the imagination and the devotion that give the staying power to see things through. A strong and united nation may be destroyed if it is unprepared against sudden attack. But even a nation well armed and well organized from a strictly military standpoint may; after a period of time; meet defeat if it is unnerved by self-distrust; endangered by class prejudice; by dissension between capital and labor; by false economy and by other unsolved social problems at home. In meeting the troubles of the world we must meet them as one peopleâ€”with a unity born of the fact that for generations those who have come to our shores; representing many kindreds and tongues; have been welded by common opportunity into a united patriotism. If another form of government can present a united front in its attack on a democracy; the attack must and will be met by a united democracy. Such a democracy can and must exist in the United States. A dictatorship may command the full strength of a regimented nation. But the united strength of a democratic nation can be mustered only when its people; educated by modern standards to know what is going on and where they are going; have conviction that they are receiving as large a share of opportunity for development; as large a share of material success and of human dignity; as they have a right to receive. Our nation's program of social and economic reform is therefore a part of defense; as basic as armaments themselves. Against the background of events in Europe; in Africa and in Asia during these recent years; the pattern of what we have accomplished since 1933 appears in even clearer focus. For the first time we have moved upon deep-seated problems affecting our national strength and have forged national instruments adequate to meet them. Consider what the seemingly piecemeal struggles of these six years add up to in terms of realistic national preparedness. We are conserving and developing natural resourcesâ€”land; water power; forests. We are trying to provide necessary food; shelter and medical care for the health of our population. We are putting agricultureâ€”our system of food and fibre supplyâ€”on a sounder basis. We are strengthening the weakest spot in our system of industrial supplyâ€” its long smouldering labor difficulties. We have cleaned up our credit system so that depositor and investor alike may more readily and willingly make their capital available for peace or war. We are giving to our youth new opportunities for work and education. We have sustained the morale of all the population by the dignified recognition of our obligations to the aged; the helpless and the needy. Above all; we have made the American people conscious of their interrelationship and their interdependence. They sense a common destiny and a common need of each other. Differences of occupation; geography; race and religion no longer obscure the nation's fundamental unity in thought and in action. We have our difficulties; trueâ€”but we are a wiser and a tougher nation than we were in 1929; or in 1932. Never have there been six years of such far-flung internal preparedness in our history. And this has been done without any dictator's power to command; without conscription of labor or confiscation of capital; without concentration camps and without a scratch on freedom of speech; freedom of the press or the rest of the Bill of Rights. We see things now that we could not see along the way. The tools of government which we had in 1933 are outmoded. We have had to forge new tools for a new role of government operating in a democracyâ€”a role of new responsibility for new needs and increased responsibility for old needs; long neglected. Some of these tools had to be roughly shaped and still need some machining down. Many of those who fought bitterly against the forging of these new tools welcome their use today. The American people; as a whole; have accepted them. The Nation looks to the Congress to improve the new machinery which we have permanently installed; provided that in the process the social usefulness of the machinery is not destroyed or impaired. All of us agree that we should simplify and improve laws if experience and operation clearly demonstrate the need. For instance; all of us want better provision for our older people under our social security legislation. For the medically needy we must provide better care. Most of us agree that for the sake of employer and employee alike we must find ways to end factional labor strife and employer-employee disputes. Most of us recognize that none of these tools can be put to maximum effectiveness unless the executive processes of government are revampedâ€”reorganized; if you willâ€”into more effective combination. And even after such reorganization it will take time to develop administrative personnel and experience in order to use our new tools with a minimum of mistakes. The Congress; of course; needs no further information on this. With this exception of legislation to provide greater government efficiency; and with the exception of legislation to ameliorate our railroad and other transportation problems; the past three Congresses have met in part or in whole the pressing needs of the new order of things. We have now passed the period of internal conflict in the launching of our program of social reform. Our full energies may now be released to invigorate the processes of recovery in order to preserve our reforms; and to give every man and woman who wants to work a real job at a living wage. But time is of paramount importance. The deadline of danger from within and from without is not within our control. The hour-glass may be in the hands of other nations. Our own hour-glass tells us that we are off on a race to make democracy work; so that we may be efficient in peace and therefore secure in national defense. This time element forces us to still greater efforts to attain the full employment of our labor and our capital. The first duty of our statesmanship is to bring capital and man-power together. Dictatorships do this by main force. By using main force they apparently succeed at itâ€”for the moment. However we abhor their methods; we are compelled to admit that they have obtained substantial utilization of all their material and human resources. Like it or not; they have solved; for a time at least; the problem of idle men and idle capital. Can we compete with them by boldly seeking methods of putting idle men and idle capital together and; at the same time; remain within our American way of life; within the Bill of Rights; and within the bounds of what is; from our point of view; civilization itself? We suffer from a great unemployment of capital. Many people have the idea that as a nation we are overburdened with debt and are spending more than we can afford. That is not so. Despite our Federal Government expenditures the entire debt of our national economic system; public and private together; is no larger today than it was in 1929; and the interest thereon is far less than it was in 1929. The object is to put capitalâ€”private as well as publicâ€”to work. We want to get enough capital and labor at work to give us a total turnover of business; a total national income; of at least eighty billion dollars a year. At that figure we shall have a substantial reduction of unemployment; and the Federal Revenues will be sufficient to balance the current level of cash expenditures on the basis of the existing tax structure. That figure can be attained; working within the framework of our traditional profit system. The factors in attaining and maintaining that amount of national income are many and complicated. They include more widespread understanding among business men of many changes which world conditions and technological improvements have brought to our economy over the last twenty yearsâ€”changes in the interrelationship of price and volume and employment; for exampleâ€”changes of the kind in which business men are now educating themselves through excellent opportunities like the so-called ""monopoly investigation."" They include a perfecting of our farm program to protect farmers' income and consumers' purchasing power from alternate risks of crop gluts and crop shortages. They include wholehearted acceptance of new standards of honesty in our financial markets. They include reconcilement of enormous; antagonistic interestsâ€”some of them long in litigationâ€”in the railroad and general transportation field. They include the working out of new techniquesâ€”private; state and federalâ€”to protect the public interest in and to develop wider markets for electric power. They include a revamping of the tax relationships between federal; state and local units of government; and consideration of relatively small tax increases to adjust inequalities without interfering with the aggregate income of the American people. They include the perfecting of labor organization and a universal ungrudging attitude by employers toward the labor movement; until there is a minimum of interruption of production and employment because of disputes; and acceptance by labor of the truth that the welfare of labor itself depends on increased balanced out-put of goods. To be immediately practical; while proceeding with a steady evolution in the solving of these and like problems; we must wisely use instrumentalities; like Federal investment; which are immediately available to us. Here; as elsewhere; time is the deciding factor in our choice of remedies. Therefore; it does not seem logical to me; at the moment we seek to increase production and consumption; for the Federal Government to consider a drastic curtailment of its own investments. The whole subject of government investing and government income is one which may be approached in two different ways. The first calls for the elimination of enough activities of government to bring the expenses of government immediately into balance with income of government. This school of thought maintains that because our national income this year is only sixty billion dollars; ours is only a sixty billion dollar country; that government must treat it as such; and that without the help of government; it may some day; somehow; happen to become an eighty billion dollar country. If the Congress decides to accept this point of view; it will logically have to reduce the present functions or activities of government by one-third. Not only will the Congress have to accept the responsibility for such reduction; but the Congress will have to determine which activities are to be reduced. Certain expenditures we cannot possibly reduce at this session; such as the interest on the public debt. A few million dollars saved here or there in the normal or in curtailed work of the old departments and commissions will make no great saving in the Federal budget. Therefore; the Congress would have to reduce drastically some of certain large items; very large items; such as aids to agriculture and soil conservation; veterans' pensions; flood control; highways; waterways and other public works; grants for social and health security; Civilian Conservation Corps activities; relief for the unemployed; or national defense itself. The Congress alone has the power to do all this; as it is the appropriating branch of the government. The other approach to the question of government spending takes the position that this Nation ought not to be and need not be only a sixty billion dollar nation; that at this moment it has the men and the resources sufficient to make it at least an eighty billion dollar nation. This school of thought does not believe that it can become an eighty billion dollar nation in the near future if government cuts its operations by one-third. It is convinced that if we were to try it; we would invite disasterâ€”and that we would not long remain even a sixty billion dollar nation. There are many complicated factors with which we have to deal; but we have learned that it is unsafe to make abrupt reductions at any time in our net expenditure program. By our common sense action of resuming government activities last spring; we have reversed a recession and started the new rising tide of prosperity and national income which we are now just beginning to enjoy. If government activities are fully maintained; there is a good prospect of our becoming an eighty billion dollar country in a very short time. With such a national income; present tax laws will yield enough each year to balance each year's expenses. It is my conviction that down in their hearts the American publicâ€”industry; agriculture; financeâ€”want this Congress to do whatever needs to be done to raise our national income to eighty billion dollars a year. Investing soundly must preclude spending wastefully. To guard against opportunist appropriations; I have on several occasions addressed the Congress on the importance of permanent long-range planning. I hope; therefore; that following my recommendation of last year; a permanent agency will be set up and authorized to report on the urgency and desirability of the various types of government investment. Investment for prosperity can be made in a democracy. I hear some people say; ""This is all so complicated. There are certain advantages in a dictatorship. It gets rid of labor trouble; of unemployment; of wasted motion and of having to do your own thinking."" My answer is; ""Yes; but it also gets rid of some other things which we Americans intend very definitely to keepâ€”and we still intend to do our own thinking."" It will cost us taxes and the voluntary risk of capital to attain some of the practical advantages which other forms of government have acquired. Dictatorship; however; involves costs which the American people will never pay: The cost of our spiritual values. The cost of the blessed right of being able to say what we please. The cost of freedom of religion. The cost of seeing our capital confiscated. The cost of being cast into a concentration camp. The cost of being afraid to walk down the street with the wrong neighbor. The cost of having our children brought up; not as free and dignified human beings; but as pawns molded and enslaved by a machine. If the avoidance of these costs means taxes on my income; if avoiding these costs means taxes on my estate at death; I would bear those taxes willingly as the price of my breathing and my children breathing the free air of a free country; as the price of a living and not a dead world. Events abroad have made it increasingly clear to the American people that dangers within are less to be feared than dangers from without. If; therefore; a solution of this problem of idle men and idle capital is the price of preserving our liberty; no formless selfish fears can stand in the way. Once I prophesied that this generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. That prophecy comes true. To us much is given; more is expected. This generation will ""nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth. . . . The way is plain; peaceful; generous; justâ€”a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless."""
Franklin Roosevelt, January-6-1942, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-Franklin-D-Roosevelt-January-6-1942, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsFranklin-Roosevelt-January-6-1942-speech," In fulfilling my duty to report upon the State of the Union; I am proud to say to you that the spirit of the American people was never higher than it is todayâ€”the Union was never more closely knit togetherâ€”this country was never more deeply determined to face the solemn tasks before it. The response of the American people has been instantaneous; and it will be sustained until our security is assured. Exactly one year ago today I said to this Congress: ""When the dictators. . . are ready to make war upon us; they will not wait for an act of war on our part. . . . Theyâ€”not weâ€”will choose the time and the place and the method of their attack."" We now know their choice of the time: a peaceful Sunday morningâ€”December 7; 1941. We know their choice of the place: an American outpost in the Pacific. We know their choice of the method: the method of Hitler himself. Japan's scheme of conquest goes back half a century. It was not merely a policy of seeking living room: it was a plan which included the subjugation of all the peoples in the Far East and in the islands of the Pacific; and the domination of that ocean by Japanese military and naval control of the western coasts of North; Central; and South America. The development of this ambitious conspiracy was marked by the war against China in 1894; the subsequent occupation of Korea; the war against Russia in 1904; the illegal fortification of the mandated Pacific islands following 1920; the seizure of Manchuria in 1931; and the invasion of China in 1937. A similar policy of criminal conquest was adopted by Italy. The Fascists first revealed their imperial designs in Libya and Tripoli. In 1935 they seized Abyssinia. Their goal was the domination of all North Africa; Egypt; parts of France; and the entire Mediterranean world. But the dreams of empire of the Japanese and Fascist leaders were modest in comparison with the gargantuan aspirations of Hitler and his Nazis. Even before they came to power in 1933; their plans for that conquest had been drawn. Those plans provided for ultimate domination; not of any one section of the world; but of the whole earth and all the oceans on it. When Hitler organized his Berlin-Rome-Tokyo alliance; all these plans of conquest became a single plan. Under this; in addition to her own schemes of conquest; Japan's role was obviously to cut off our supply of weapons of war to Britain; and Russia and Chinaâ€”weapons which increasingly were speeding the day of Hitler's doom. The act of Japan at Pearl Harbor was intended to stun usâ€”to terrify us to such an extent that we would divert our industrial and military strength to the Pacific area; or even to our own continental defense. The plan has failed in its purpose. We have not been stunned. We have not been terrified or confused. This very reassembling of the Seventy-seventh Congress today is proof of that; for the mood of quiet; grim resolution which here prevails bodes ill for those who conspired and collaborated to murder world peace. That mood is stronger than any mere desire for revenge. It expresses the will of the American people to make very certain that the world will never so suffer again. Admittedly; we have been faced with hard choices. It was bitter; for example; not to be able to relieve the heroic and historic defenders of Wake Island. It was bitter for us not to be able to land a million men in a thousand ships in the Philippine Islands. But this adds only to our determination to see to it that the Stars and Stripes will fly again over Wake and Guam. Yes; see to it that the brave people of the Philippines will be rid of Japanese imperialism; and will live in freedom; security; and independence. Powerful and offensive actions must and will be taken in proper time. The consolidation of the United Nations' total war effort against our common enemies is being achieved. That was and is the purpose of conferences which have been held during the past two weeks in Washington; and Moscow and Chungking. That is the primary objective of the declaration of solidarity signed in Washington on January 1; 1942; by 26 Nations united against the Axis powers. Difficult choices may have to be made in the months to come. We do not shrink from such decisions. We and those united with us will make those decisions with courage and determination. Plans have been laid here and in the other capitals for coordinated and cooperative action by all the United Nationsâ€”military action and economic action. Already we have established; as you know; unified command of land; sea; and air forces in the southwestern Pacific theater of war. There will be a continuation of conferences and consultations among military staffs; so that the plans and operations of each will fit into the general strategy designed to crush the enemy. We shall not fight isolated warsâ€”each Nation going its own way. These 26 Nations are unitedâ€”not in spirit and determination alone; but in the broad conduct of the war in all its phases. For the first time since the Japanese and the Fascists and the Nazis started along their blood-stained course of conquest they now face the fact that superior forces are assembling against them. Gone forever are the days when the aggressors could attack and destroy their victims one by one without unity of resistance. We of the United Nations will so dispose our forces that we can strike at the common enemy wherever the greatest damage can be done him. The militarists of Berlin and Tokyo started this war. But the massed; angered forces of common humanity will finish it. Destruction of the material and spiritual centers of civilizationâ€”this has been and still is the purpose of Hitler and his Italian and Japanese chessmen. They would wreck the power of the British Commonwealth and Russia and China and the Netherlandsâ€”and then combine all their forces to achieve their ultimate goal; the conquest of the United States. They know that victory for us means victory for freedom. They know that victory for us means victory for the institution of democracyâ€”the ideal of the family; the simple principles of common decency and humanity. They know that victory for us means victory for religion. And they could not tolerate that. The world is too small to provide adequate ""living room"" for both Hitler and God. In proof of that; the Nazis have now announced their plan for enforcing their new German; pagan religion all over the worldâ€”a plan by which the Holy Bible and the Cross of Mercy would be displaced by Mein Kampf and the swastika and the naked sword. Our own objectives are clear; the objective of smashing the militarism imposed by war lords upon their enslaved peoples the objective of liberating the subjugated Nationsâ€”the objective of establishing and securing freedom of speech; freedom of religion; freedom from want; and freedom from fear everywhere in the world. We shall not stop short of these objectivesâ€”nor shall we be satisfied merely to gain them and then call it a day. I know that I speak for the American peopleâ€”and I have good reason to believe that I speak also for all the other peoples who fight with usâ€”when I say that this time we are determined not only to win the war; but also to maintain the security of the peace that will follow. But we know that modern methods of warfare make it a task; not only of shooting and fighting; but an even more urgent one of working and producing. Victory requires the actual weapons of war and the means of transporting them to a dozen points of combat. It will not be sufficient for us and the other United Nations to produce a slightly superior supply of munitions to that of Germany; Japan; Italy; and the stolen industries in the countries which they have overrun. The superiority of the United Nations in munitions and ships must be overwhelmingâ€”so overwhelming that the Axis Nations can never hope to catch up with it. And so; in order to attain this overwhelming superiority the United States must build planes and tanks and guns and ships to the utmost limit of our national capacity. We have the ability and capacity to produce arms not only for our own forces; but also for the armies; navies; and air forces fighting on our side. And our overwhelming superiority of armament must be adequate to put weapons of war at the proper time into the hands of those men in the conquered Nations who stand ready to seize the first opportunity to revolt against their German and Japanese oppressors; and against the traitors in their own ranks; known by the already infamous name of ""Quislings."" And I think that it is a fair prophecy to say that; as we get guns to the patriots in those lands; they too will fire shots heard 'round the world. This production of ours in the United States must be raised far above present levels; even though it will mean the dislocation of the lives and occupations of millions of our own people. We must raise our sights all along the production line. Let no man say it cannot be done. It must be doneâ€”and we have undertaken to do it. I have just sent a letter of directive to the appropriate departments and agencies of our Government; ordering that immediate steps be taken: First; to increase our production rate of airplanes so rapidly that in this year; 1942; we shall produce 60;000 planes; 10;000 more than the goal that we set a year and a half ago. This includes 45;000 combat planesâ€”bombers; dive bombers; pursuit planes. The rate of increase will be maintained and continued so that next year; 1943; we shall produce 125;000 airplanes; including 100;000 combat planes. Second; to increase our production rate of tanks so rapidly that in this year; 1942; we shall produce 45;000 tanks; and to continue that increase so that next year; 1943; we shall produce 75;000 tanks. Third; to increase our production rate of anti-aircraft guns so rapidly that in this year; 1942; we shall produce 20;000 of them; and to continue that increase so that next year; 1943; we shall produce 35;000 anti-aircraft guns. And fourth; to increase our production rate of merchant ships so rapidly that in this year; 1942; we shall build 6;000;000 deadweight tons as compared with a 1941 completed production of 1;100;000. And finally; we shall continue that increase so that next year; 1943; we shall build 10;000;000 tons of shipping. These figures and similar figures for a multitude of other implements of war will give the Japanese and the Nazis a little idea of just what they accomplished in the attack at Pearl Harbor. And I rather hope that all these figures which I have given will become common knowledge in Germany and Japan. Our task is hardâ€”our task is unprecedentedâ€”and the time is short. We must strain every existing armament-producing facility to the utmost. We must convert every available plant and tool to war production. That goes all the way from the greatest plants to the smallestâ€”from the huge automobile industry to the village machine shop. Production for war is based on men and womenâ€”the human hands and brains which collectively we call Labor. Our workers stand ready to work long hours; to turn out more in a day's work; to keep the wheels turning and the fires burning twenty-four hours a day; and seven days a week. They realize well that on the speed and efficiency of their work depend the lives of their sons and their brothers on the fighting fronts. Production for war is based on metals and raw materialsâ€”steel; copper; rubber; aluminum; zinc; tin. Greater and greater quantities of them will have to be diverted to war purposes. Civilian use of them will have to be cut further and still furtherâ€”and; in many cases; completely eliminated. War costs money. So far; we have hardly even begun to pay for it. We have devoted only 15 percent of our national income to national defense. As will appear in my Budget Message tomorrow; our war program for the coming fiscal year will cost 56 billion dollars or; in other words; more than half of the estimated annual national income. That means taxes and bonds and bonds and taxes. It means cutting luxuries and other non-essentials. In a word; it means an ""all-out"" war by individual effort and family effort in a united country. Only this all-out scale of production will hasten the ultimate all-out victory. Speed will count. Lost ground can always be regainedâ€”lost time never. Speed will save lives; speed will save this Nation which is in peril; speed will save our freedom and our civilizationâ€”and slowness has never been an American characteristic. As the United States goes into its full stride; we must always be on guard against misconceptions which will arise; some of them naturally; or which will be planted among us by our enemies. We must guard against complacency. We must not underrate the enemy. He is powerful and cunningâ€”and cruel and ruthless. He will stop at nothing that gives him a chance to kill and to destroy. He has trained his people to believe that their highest perfection is achieved by waging war. For many years he has prepared for this very conflictâ€”planning; and plotting; and training; arming; and fighting. We have already tasted defeat. We may suffer further setbacks. We must face the fact of a hard war; a long war; a bloody war; a costly war. We must; on the other hand; guard against defeatism. That has been one of the chief weapons of Hitler's propaganda machineâ€”used time and again with deadly results. It will not be used successfully on the American people. We must guard against divisions among ourselves and among all the other United Nations. We must be particularly vigilant against racial discrimination in any of its ugly forms. Hitler will try again to breed mistrust and suspicion between one individual and another; one group and another; one race and another; one Government and another. He will try to use the same technique of falsehood and rumor-mongering with which he divided France from Britain. He is trying to do this with us even now. But he will find a unity of will and purpose against him; which will persevere until the destruction of all his black designs upon the freedom and safety of the people of the world. We cannot wage this war in a defensive spirit. As our power and our resources are fully mobilized; we shall carry the attack against the enemyâ€”we shall hit him and hit him again wherever and whenever we can reach him. We must keep him far from our shores; for we intend to bring this battle to him on his own home grounds. American armed forces must be used at any place in all the world where it seems advisable to engage the forces of the enemy. In some cases these operations will be defensive; in order to protect key positions. In other cases; these operations will be offensive; in order to strike at the common enemy; with a view to his complete encirclement and eventual total defeat. American armed forces will operate at many points in the Far East. American armed forces will be on all the oceansâ€”helping to guard the essential communications which are vital to the United Nations. American land and air and sea forces will take stations in the British Islesâ€”which constitute an essential fortress in this great world struggle. American armed forces will help to protect this hemisphereâ€”and also help to protect bases outside this hemisphere; which could be used for an attack on the Americas. If any of our enemies; from Europe or from Asia; attempt long-range raids by ""suicide"" squadrons of bombing planes; they will do so only in the hope of terrorizing our people and disrupting our morale. Our people are not afraid of that. We know that we may have to pay a heavy price for freedom. We will pay this price with a will. Whatever the price; it is a thousand times worth it. No matter what our enemies; in their desperation; may attempt to do to usâ€”we will say; as the people of London have said; ""We can take it."" And what's more we can give it back and we will give it backâ€”with compound interest. When our enemies challenged our country to stand up and fight; they challenged each and every one of us. And each and every one of us has accepted the challengeâ€”for himself and for his Nation. There were only some 400 United States Marines who in the heroic and historic defense of Wake Island inflicted such great losses on the enemy. Some of those men were killed in action; and others are now prisoners of war. When the survivors of that great fight are liberated and restored to their homes; they will learn that a hundred and thirty million of their fellow citizens have been inspired to render their own full share of service and sacrifice. We can well say that our men on the fighting fronts have already proved that Americans today are just as rugged and just as tough as any of the heroes whose exploits we celebrate on the Fourth of July. Many people ask; ""When will this war end?"" There is only one answer to that. It will end just as soon as we make it end; by our combined efforts; our combined strength; our combined determination to fight through and work through until the endâ€”the end of militarism in Germany and Italy and Japan. Most certainly we shall not settle for less. That is the spirit in which discussions have been conducted during the visit of the British Prime Minister to Washington. Mr. Churchill and I understand each other; our motives and our purposes. Together; during the past two weeks; we have faced squarely the major military and economic problems of this greatest world war. All in our Nation have been cheered by Mr. Churchill's visit. We have been deeply stirred by his great message to us. He is welcome in our midst; and we unite in wishing him a safe return to his home. For we are fighting on the same side with the British people; who fought alone for long; terrible months; and withstood the enemy with fortitude and tenacity and skill. We are fighting on the same side with the Russian people who have seen the Nazi hordes swarm up to the very gates of Moscow; and who with almost superhuman will and courage have forced the invaders back into retreat. We are fighting on the same side as the brave people of Chinaâ€”those millions who for four and a half long years have withstood bombs and starvation and have whipped the invaders time and again in spite of the superior Japanese equipment and arms. Yes; we are fighting on the same side as the indomitable Dutch. We are fighting on the same side as all the other Governments in exile; whom Hitler and all his armies and all his Gestapo have not been able to conquer. But we of the United Nations are not making all this sacrifice of human effort and human lives to return to the kind of world we had after the last world war. We are fighting today for security; for progress; and for peace; not only for ourselves but for all men; not only for one generation but for all generations. We are fighting to cleanse the world of ancient evils; ancient ills. Our enemies are guided by brutal cynicism; by unholy contempt for the human race. We are inspired by a faith that goes back through all the years to the first chapter of the Book of Genesis: ""God created man in His own image."" We on our side are striving to be true to that divine heritage. We are fighting; as our fathers have fought; to uphold the doctrine that all men are equal in the sight of God. Those on the other side are striving to destroy this deep belief and to create a world in their own imageâ€”a world of tyranny and cruelty and serfdom. That is the conflict that day and night now pervades our lives. No compromise can end that conflict. There never has beenâ€”there never can beâ€”successful compromise between good and evil. Only total victory can reward the champions of tolerance; and decency; and freedom; and faith."

Andrew Jackson, December-6-1830, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-Andrew-Jackson-December-6-1830, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsAndrew-Jackson-December-6-1830-speech," Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The pleasure I have in congratulating you upon your return to your constitutional duties is much heightened by the satisfaction which the condition of our beloved country at this period justly inspires. The beneficent Author of All Good has granted to us during the present year health; peace; and plenty; and numerous causes for joy in the wonderful success which attends the progress of our free institutions. With a population unparalleled in its increase; and possessing a character which combines the hardihood of enterprise with the considerateness of wisdom; we see in every section of our happy country a steady improvement in the means of social intercourse; and correspondent effects upon the genius and laws of our extended Republic. The apparent exceptions to the harmony of the prospect are to be referred rather to inevitable diversities in the various interests which enter into the composition of so extensive a whole than any want of attachment to the Unionâ€”interests whose collisions serve only in the end to foster the spirit of conciliation and patriotism so essential to the preservation of that Union which I most devoutly hope is destined to prove imperishable. In the midst of these blessings we have recently witnessed changes in the conditions of other nations which may in their consequences call for the utmost vigilance; wisdom; and unanimity in our councils; and the exercise of all the moderation and patriotism of our people. The important modifications of their Government; effected with so much courage and wisdom by the people of France; afford a happy presage of their future course; and have naturally elicited from the kindred feelings of this nation that spontaneous and universal burst of applause in which you have participated. In congratulating you; my fellow citizens; upon an event so auspicious to the dearest interests of man-kind I do no more than respond to the voice of my country; without transcending in the slightest degree that salutary maxim of the illustrious Washington which enjoins an abstinence from all interference with the internal affairs of other nations. From a people exercising in the most unlimited degree the right of self-government; and enjoying; as derived from this proud characteristic; under the favor of Heaven; much of the happiness with which they are blessed; a people who can point in triumph to their free institutions and challenge comparison with the fruits they bear; as well as with the moderation; intelligence; and energy with which they are administeredâ€” from such a people the deepest sympathy was to be expected in a struggle for the sacred principles of liberty; conducted in a spirit every way worthy of the cause; and crowned by a heroic moderation which has disarmed revolution of its terrors. Not withstanding the strong assurances which the man whom we so sincerely love and justly admire has given to the world of the high character of the present King of the French; and which if sustained to the end will secure to him the proud appellation of Patriot King; it is not in his success; but in that of the great principle which has borne him to the throneâ€”the paramount authority of the public willâ€”that the American people rejoice. I am happy to inform you that the anticipations which were indulged at the date of my last communication on the subject of our foreign affairs have been fully realized in several important particulars. An arrangement has been effected with Great Britain in relation to the trade between the United States and her West India and North American colonies which has settled a question that has for years afforded matter for contention and almost uninterrupted discussion; and has been the subject of no less than six negotiations; in a manner which promises results highly favorable to the parties. The abstract right of Great Britain to monopolize the trade with her colonies or to exclude us from a participation therein has never been denied by the United States. But we have contended; and with reason; that if at any time Great Britain may desire the productions of this country as necessary to her colonies they must be received upon principles of just reciprocity; and; further; that it is making an invidious and unfriendly distinction to open her colonial ports to the vessels of other nations and close them against those of the United States. Antecedently to 1794 a portion of our productions was admitted into the colonial islands of Great Britain by particular concessions; limited to the term of one year; but renewed from year to year. In the transportation of these productions; however; our vessels were not allowed to engage; this being a privilege reserved to British shipping; by which alone our produce could be taken to the islands and theirs brought to us in return. From Newfoundland and her continental possessions all our productions; as well as our vessels; were excluded; with occasional relaxations; by which; in seasons of distress; the former were admitted in British bottoms. By the treaty of 1794 she offered to concede to us for a limited time the right of carrying to her West India possessions in our vessels not exceeding 70 tons burthen; and upon the same terms as British vessels; any productions of the United States which British vessels might import therefrom. But this privilege was coupled with conditions which are supposed to have led to its rejection by the Senate; that is; that American vessels should land their return cargoes in the United States only; and; moreover; that they should during the continuance of the privilege be precluded from carrying molasses; sugar; coffee; cocoa; or cotton either from those islands or from the United States to any other part of the world. Great Britain readily consented to expunge this article from the treaty; and subsequent attempts to arrange the terms of the trade either by treaty stipulations or concerted legislation have failed; it has been successively suspended and allowed according to the varying legislation of the parties. The following are the prominent points which have in later years separated the two Governments: Besides a restriction whereby all importations into her colonies in American vessels are confined to our own products carried hence; a restriction to which it does not appear that we have ever objected; a leading object on the part of Great Britain has been to prevent us from becoming the carriers of British West India commodities to any other country than our own. On the part of the United States it has been contended; first; that the subject should be regulated by treaty stipulation in preference to separate legislation; second; that our productions; when imported into the colonies in question; should not be subject to higher duties than the productions of the mother country or of her other colonial possessions; and; 3rd; that our vessels should be allowed to participate in the circuitous trade between the United States and different parts of the British dominions. The first point; after having been for a long time strenuously insisted upon by Great Britain; was given up by the act of Parliament of July; 1825; all vessels suffered to trade with the colonies being permitted to clear from thence with any articles which British vessels might export and proceed to any part of the world; Great Britain and her dependencies alone excepted. On our part each of the above points had in succession been explicitly abandoned in negotiations preceding that of which the result is now announced. This arrangement secures to the United States every advantage asked by them; and which the state of the negotiation allowed us to insist upon. The trade will be placed upon a footing decidedly more favorable to this country than any on which it ever stood; and our commerce and navigation will enjoy in the colonial ports of Great Britain every privilege allowed to other nations. That the prosperity of the country so far as it depends on this trade will be greatly promoted by the new arrangement there can be no doubt. Independently of the more obvious advantages of an open and direct intercourse; its establishment will be attended with other consequences of a higher value. That which has been carried on since the mutual interdict under all the expense and inconvenience unavoidably incident to it would have been insupportably onerous had it not been in a great degree lightened by concerted evasions in the mode of making the transshipments at what are called the neutral ports. These indirections are inconsistent with the dignity of nations that have so many motives not only to cherish feelings of mutual friendship; but to maintain such relations as will stimulate their respective citizens and subjects to efforts of direct; open; and honorable competition only; and preserve them from the influence of seductive and vitiating circumstances. When your preliminary interposition was asked at the close of the last session; a copy of the instructions under which Mr. McLane has acted; together with the communications which had at that time passed between him and the British Government; was laid before you. Although there has not been any thing in the acts of the two Governments which requires secrecy; it was thought most proper in the then state of the negotiation to make that communication a confidential one. So soon; however; as the evidence of execution on the part of Great Britain is received the whole matter shall be laid before you; when it will be seen that the apprehension which appears to have suggested one of the provisions of the act passed at your last session; that the restoration of the trade in question might be connected with other subjects and was sought to be obtained at the sacrifice of the public interest in other particulars; was wholly unfounded; and that the change which has taken place in the views of the British Government has been induced by considerations as honorable to both parties as I trust the result will prove beneficial. This desirable result was; it will be seen; greatly promoted by the liberal and confiding provisions of the act of Congress of the last session; by which our ports were upon the reception and annunciation by the President of the required assurance on the part of Great Britain forthwith opened to her vessels before the arrangement could be carried into effect on her part; pursuing in this act of prospective legislation a similar course to that adopted by Great Britain in abolishing; by her act of Parliament in 1825; a restriction then existing and permitting our vessels to clear from the colonies on their return voyages for any foreign country whatever before British vessels had been relieved from the restriction imposed by our law of returning directly from the United States to the colonies; a restriction which she required and expected that we should abolish. Upon each occasion a limited and temporary advantage has been given to the opposite party; but an advantage of no importance in comparison with the restoration of mutual confidence and good feeling; and the ultimate establishment of the trade upon fair principles. It gives me unfeigned pleasure to assure you that this negotiation has been throughout characterized by the most frank and friendly spirit on the part of Great Britain; and concluded in a manner strongly indicative of a sincere desire to cultivate the best relations with the United States. To reciprocate this disposition to the fullest extent of my ability is a duty which I shall deem it a privilege to discharge. Although the result is itself the best commentary on the services rendered to his country by our minister at the Court of St. James; it would be doing violence to my feelings were I to dismiss the subject without expressing the very high sense I entertain of the talent and exertion which have been displayed by him on the occasion. The injury to the commerce of the United States resulting from the exclusion of our vessels from the Black Sea and the previous footing of mere sufferance upon which even the limited trade enjoyed by us with Turkey has hitherto been placed have for a long time been a source of much solicitude to this Government; and several endeavors have been made to obtain a better state of things. Sensible of the importance of the object; I felt it my duty to leave no proper means unemployed to acquire for our flag the same privileges that are enjoyed by the principal powers of Europe. Commissioners were consequently appointed to open a negotiation with the Sublime Porte. Not long after the member of the commission who went directly from the United States had sailed; the account of the treaty of Adrianople; by which one of the objects in view was supposed to be secured; reached this country. The Black Sea was understood to be opened to us. Under the supposition that this was the case; the additional facilities to be derived from the establishment of commercial regulations with the Porte were deemed of sufficient importance to require a prosecution of the negotiation as originally contemplated. It was therefore persevered in; and resulted in a treaty; which will be forthwith laid before the Senate. By its provisions a free passage is secured; without limitations of time; to the vessels of the United States to and from the Black Sea; including the navigation thereof; and our trade with Turkey is placed on the footing of the most favored nation. The latter is an arrangement wholly independent of the treaty of Adrianople; and the former derives much value; not only from the increased security which under any circumstances it would give to the right in question; but from the fact; ascertained in the course of the negotiation; that by the construction put upon that treaty by Turkey the article relating to the passage of the Bosphorus is confined to nations having treaties with the Porte. The most friendly feelings appear to be entertained by the Sultan; and an enlightened disposition is evinced by him to foster the intercourse between the two countries by the most liberal arrangements. This disposition it will be our duty and interest to cherish. Our relations with Russia are of the most stable character. Respect for that Empire and confidence in its friendship toward the United States have been so long entertained on our part and so carefully cherished by the present Emperor and his illustrious predecessor as to have become incorporated with the public sentiment of the United States. No means will be left unemployed on my part to promote these salutary feelings and those improvements of which the commercial intercourse between the two countries is susceptible; and which have derived increased importance from our treaty with the Sublime Porte. I sincerely regret to inform you that our minister lately commissioned to that Court; on whose distinguished talents and great experience in public affairs I place great reliance; has been compelled by extreme indisposition to exercise a privilege which; in consideration of the extent to which his constitution had been impaired in the public service; was committed to his discretionâ€”of leaving temporarily his post for the advantage of a more genial climate. If; as it is to be hoped; the improvement of his health should be such as to justify him in doing so; he will repair to St. Petersburg and resume the discharge of his official duties. I have received the most satisfactory assurances that in the mean time the public interest in that quarter will be preserved from prejudice by the intercourse which he will continue through the secretary of legation with the Russian cabinet. You are apprised; although the fact has not yet been officially announced to the House of Representatives; that a treaty was in the month of March last concluded between the United States; and Denmark; by which $650 thousand are secured to our citizens as an indemnity for spoliations upon their commerce in the years 1808; 1809; 1810; and 1811. This treaty was sanctioned by the Senate at the close of its last session; and it now becomes the duty of Congress to pass the necessary laws for the organization of the board of commissioners to distribute the indemnity among the claimants. It is an agreeable circumstance in this adjustment that the terms are in conformity with the previously ascertained views of the claimants themselves; thus removing all pretense for a future agitation of the subject in any form. The negotiations in regard to such points in our foreign relations as remain to be adjusted have been actively prosecuted during the recess. Material advances have been made; which are of a character to promise favorable results. Our country; by the blessing of God; is not in a situation to invite aggression; and it will be our fault if she ever becomes so. Sincerely desirous to cultivate the most liberal and friendly relations with all; ever ready to fulfill our engagements with scrupulous fidelity; limiting our demands upon others to mere justice; holding ourselves ever ready to do unto them as we would wish to be done by; and avoiding even the appearance of undue partiality to any nation; it appears to me impossible that a simple and sincere application of our principles to our foreign relations can fail to place them ultimately upon the footing on which it is our wish they should rest. Of the points referred to; the most prominent are our claims upon France for spoliations upon our commerce; similar claims upon Spain; together with embarrassments in the commercial intercourse between the two countries which ought to be removed; the conclusion of the treaty of commerce and navigation with Mexico; which has been so long in suspense; as well as the final settlement of limits between ourselves and that Republic; and; finally; the arbitrament of the question between the United States and Great Britain in regard to the north-eastern boundary. The negotiation with France has been conducted by our minister with zeal and ability; and in all respects to my entire satisfaction. Although the prospect of a favorable termination was occasionally dimmed by counter pretensions to which the United States could not assent; he yet had strong hopes of being able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the late Government. The negotiation has been renewed with the present authorities; and; sensible of the general and lively confidence of our citizens in the justice and magnanimity of regenerated France; I regret the more not to have it in my power yet to announce the result so confidently anticipated. No ground; however; inconsistent with this expectation has yet been taken; and I do not allow myself to doubt that justice will soon be done us. The amount of the claims; the length of time they have remained unsatisfied; and their incontrovertible justice make an earnest prosecution of them by this Government an urgent duty. The illegality of the seizures and confiscations out of which they have arisen is not disputed; and what ever distinctions may have heretofore been set up in regard to the liability of the existing Government it is quite clear that such considerations can not now be interposed. The commercial intercourse between the two countries is susceptible of highly advantageous improvements; but the sense of this injury has had; and must continue to have; a very unfavorable influence upon them. From its satisfactory adjustment not only a firm and cordial friendship; but a progressive development of all their relations; may be expected. It is; therefore; my earnest hope that this old and vexatious subject of difference may be speedily removed. I feel that my confidence in our appeal to the motives which should govern a just and magnanimous nation is alike warranted by the character of the French people and by the high voucher we possess for the enlarged views and pure integrity of the Monarch who now presides over their councils; and nothing shall be wanting on my part to meet any manifestation of the spirit we anticipate in one of corresponding frankness and liberality. The subjects of difference with Spain have been brought to the view of that Government by our minister there with much force and propriety; and the strongest assurances have been received of their early and favorable consideration. The steps which remained to place the matter in controversy between Great Britain and the United States fairly before the arbitrator have all been taken in the same liberal and friendly spirit which characterized those before announced. Recent events have doubtless served to delay the decision; but our minister at the Court of the distinguished arbitrator has been assured that it will be made within the time contemplated by the treaty. I am particularly gratified in being able to state that a decidedly favorable; and; as I hope; lasting; change has been effected in our relations with the neighboring Republic of Mexico. The unfortunate and unfounded suspicions in regard to our disposition which it became my painful duty to advert to on a former occasion have been; I believe; entirely removed; and the Government of Mexico has been made to understand the real character of the wishes and views of this in regard to that country. The consequences is the establishment of friendship and mutual confidence. Such are the assurances I have received; and I see no cause to doubt their sincerity. I had reason to expect the conclusion of a commercial treaty with Mexico in season for communication on the present occasion. Circumstances which are not explained; but which I am persuaded are not the result of an indisposition on her part to enter into it; have produced the delay. There was reason to fear in the course of the last summer that the harmony of our relations might be disturbed by the acts of certain claimants; under Mexican grants; of territory which had hitherto been under our jurisdiction. The cooperation of the representative of Mexico near this Government was asked on the occasion and was readily afforded. Instructions and advice have been given to the governor of Arkansas and the officers in command in the adjoining Mexican State by which it is hoped the quiet of that frontier will be preserved until a final settlement of the dividing line shall have removed all ground of controversy. The exchange of ratifications of the treaty concluded last year with Austria has not yet taken place. The delay has been occasioned by the non-arrival of the ratification of that Government within the time prescribed by the treaty. Renewed authority has been asked for by the representative of Austria; and in the mean time the rapidly increasing trade and navigation between the two countries have been placed upon the most liberal footing of our navigation acts. Several alleged depredations have been recently committed on our commerce by the national vessels of Portugal. They have been made the subject of immediate remonstrance and reclamation. I am not yet possessed of sufficient information to express a definitive opinion of their character; but expect soon to receive it. No proper means shall be omitted to obtain for our citizens all the redress to which they may appear to be entitled. Almost at the moment of the adjournment of your last session two billsâ€”the one entitled ""An act for making appropriations for building light houses; light boats; beacons; and monuments; placing buoys; and for improving harbors and directing surveys""; and the other ""An act to authorize a subscription for stock in the Louisville and Portland Canal Company""â€”were submitted for my approval. It was not possible within the time allowed for me before the close of the session to give to these bills the consideration which was due to their character and importance; and I was compelled to retain them for that purpose. I now avail myself of this early opportunity to return them to the Houses in which they respectively originated with the reasons which; after mature deliberation; compel me to withhold my approval. The practice of defraying out of the Treasury of the United States the expenses incurred by the establishment and support of light houses; beacons; buoys; and public piers within the bays; inlets; harbors; and ports of the United States; to render the navigation thereof safe and easy; is coeval with the adoption of the Constitution; and has been continued without interruption or dispute. As our foreign commerce increased and was extended into the interior of the country by the establishment of ports of entry and delivery upon our navigable rivers the sphere of those expenditures received a corresponding enlargement. Light houses; beacons; buoys; public piers; and the removal of sand bars; sawyers; and other partial or temporary impediments in the navigable rivers and harbors which were embraced in the revenue districts from time to time established by law were authorized upon the same principle and the expense defrayed in the same manner. That these expenses have at times been extravagant and disproportionate is very probable. The circumstances under which they are incurred are well calculated to lead to such a result unless their application is subjected to the closest scrutiny. The local advantages arising from the disbursement of public money too frequently; it is to be feared; invite appropriations for objects of this character that are neither necessary nor useful. The number of light house keepers is already very large; and the bill before me proposes to add to it 51 more of various descriptions. From representations upon the subject which are understood to be entitled to respect I am induced to believe that there has not only been great improvidence in the past expenditures of the Government upon these objects; but that the security of navigation has in some instances been diminished by the multiplication of light houses and consequent change of lights upon the coast. It is in this as in other respects our duty to avoid all unnecessary expense; as well as every increase of patronage not called for by the public service. But in the discharge of that duty in this particular it must not be forgotten that in relation to our foreign commerce the burden and benefit of protecting and accommodating it necessarily go together; and must do so as long as the public revenue is drawn from the people through the custom house. It is indisputable that whatever gives facility and security to navigation cheapens imports and all who consume them are alike interested in what ever produces this effect. If they consume; they ought; as they now do; to pay; otherwise they do not pay. The consumer in the most inland State derives the same advantage from every necessary and prudent expenditure for the facility and security of our foreign commerce and navigation that he does who resides in a maritime State. Local expenditures have not of themselves a corresponding operation. From a bill making direct appropriations for such objects I should not have withheld my assent. The one now returned does so in several particulars; but it also contains appropriations for surveys of local character; which I can not approve. It gives me satisfaction to find that no serious inconvenience has arisen from withholding my approval from this bill; nor will it; I trust; be cause of regret that an opportunity will be thereby afforded for Congress to review its provisions under circumstances better calculated for full investigation than those under which it was passed. In speaking of direct appropriations I mean not to include a practice which has obtained to some extent; and to which I have in one instance; in a different capacity; given my assentâ€”that of subscribing to the stock of private associations. Positive experience and a more thorough consideration of the subject have convinced me of the impropriety as well as inexpediency of such investments. All improvements effected by the funds of the nation for general use should be open to the enjoyment of all our fellow citizens; exempt from the payment of tolls or any imposition of that character. The practice of thus mingling the concerns of the Government with those of the States or of individuals is inconsistent with the object of its institution and highly impolite. The successful operation of the federal system can only be preserved by confining it to the few and simple; but yet important; objects for which it was designed. A different practice; if allowed to progress; would ultimately change the character of this Government by consolidating into one the General and State Governments; which were intended to be kept for ever distinct. I can not perceive how bills authorizing such subscriptions can be otherwise regarded than as bills for revenue; and consequently subject to the rule in that respect prescribed by the Constitution. If the interest of the Government in private companies is subordinate to that of individuals; the management and control of a portion of the public funds is delegated to an authority unknown to the Constitution and beyond the supervision of our constituents; if superior; its officers and agents will be constantly exposed to imputations of favoritism and oppression. Direct prejudice the public interest or an alienation of the affections and respect of portions of the people may; therefore; in addition to the general discredit resulting to the Government from embarking with its constituents in pecuniary stipulations; be looked for as the probable fruit of such associations. It is no answer to this objection to say that the extent of consequences like these can not be great from a limited and small number of investments; because experience in other matters teaches usâ€”and we are not at liberty to disregard its admonitionsâ€”that unless an entire stop be put to them it will soon be impossible to prevent their accumulation until they are spread over the whole country and made to embrace many of the private and appropriate concerns of individuals. The power which the General Government would acquire within the several States by becoming the principal stock-holder in corporations; controlling every canal and each 60 or 100 miles of every important road; and giving a proportionate vote in all their elections; is almost inconceivable; and in my view dangerous to the liberties of the people. This mode of aiding such works is also in its nature deceptive; and in many cases conducive to improvidence in the administration of the national funds. Appropriations will be obtained with much greater facility and granted with less security to the public interest when the measure is thus disguised than when definite and direct expenditures of money are asked for. The interests of the nation would doubtless be better served by avoiding all such indirect modes of aiding particular objects. In a government like ours more especially should all public acts be; as far as practicable; simple; undisguised; and intelligible; that they may become fit subjects for the approbation to animadversion of the people. The bill authorizing a subscription to the Louisville and Portland Canal affords a striking illustration of the difficulty of withholding additional appropriations for the same object when the first erroneous step has been taken by instituting a partnership between the Government and private companies. It proposes a third subscription on the part of the United States; when each preceding one was at the time regarded as the extent of the aid which Government was to render to that work; and the accompanying bill for light houses; etc.; contains an appropriation for a survey of the bed of the river; with a view to its improvement by removing the obstruction which the canal is designed to avoid. This improvement; if successful; would afford a free passage of the river and render the canal entirely useless. To such improvidence is the course of legislation subject in relation to internal improvements on local matters; even with the best intentions on the part of Congress. Although the motives which have influenced me in this matter may be already sufficiently stated; I am; never the less; induced by its importance to add a few observations of a general character. In my objections to the bills authorizing subscriptions to the Maysville and Rockville road companies I expressed my views fully in regard to the power of Congress to construct roads and canals within a State of to appropriate money for improvements of a local character. I at the same time intimated me belief that the right to make app"
John Tyler, December-7-1841, https://www.infoplease.com/homework-help/us-documents/state-union-address-John-Tyler-December-7-1841, C:Usersdizad01DownloadsJohn-Tyler-December-7-1841-speech, To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: In coming together; fellow-citizens; to enter again upon the discharge of the duties with which the people have charged us severally; we find great occasion to rejoice in the general prosperity of the country. We are in the enjoyment of all the blessings of civil and religious liberty; with unexampled means of education; knowledge; and improvement. Through the year which is now drawing to a close peace has been in our borders and plenty in our habitations; and although disease has visited some few portions of the land with distress and mortality; yet in general the health of the people has been preserved; and we are all called upon by the highest obligations of duty to renew our thanks and our devotion to our Heavenly Parent; who has continued to vouchsafe to us the eminent blessings which surround us and who has so signally crowned the year with His goodness. If we find ourselves increasing beyond example in numbers; in strength; in wealth; in knowledge; in everything which promotes human and social happiness; let us ever remember our dependence for all these on the protection and merciful dispensations of Divine Providence. Since your last adjournment Alexander McLeod; a British subject who was indicted for the murder of an American citizen; and whose case has been the subject of a correspondence heretofore communicated to you; has been acquitted by the verdict of an impartial and intelligent jury; and has under the judgment of the court been regularly discharged. Great Britain having made known to this Government that the expedition which was fitted out from Canada for the destruction of the steamboat Caroline in the winter of 1837; and which resulted in the destruction of said boat and in the death of an American citizen; was undertaken by orders emanating from the authorities of the British Government in Canada; and demanding the discharge of McLeod upon the ground that if engaged in that expedition he did but fulfill the orders of his Government; has thus been answered in the only way in which she could be answered by a government the powers of which are distributed among its several departments by the fundamental law. Happily for the people of Great Britain; as well as those of the United States; the only mode by which an individual arraigned for a criminal offense before the courts of either can obtain his discharge is by the independent action of the judiciary and by proceedings equally familiar to the courts of both countries. If in Great Britain a power exists in the Crown to cause to be entered a nolle prosequi; which is not the case with the Executive power of the United States upon a prosecution pending in a State court; yet there no more than here can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from custody without an order of the proper tribunal directing his discharge. The precise stage of the proceedings at which such order may be made is a matter of municipal regulation exclusively; and not to be complained of by any other government. In cases of this kind a government becomes politically responsible only when its tribunals of last resort are shown to have rendered unjust and injurious judgments in matters not doubtful. To the establishment and elucidation of this principle no nation has lent its authority more efficiently than Great Britain. Alexander McLeod; having his option either to prosecute a writ of error from the decision of the supreme court of New York; which had been rendered upon his application for a discharge; to the Supreme Court of the United States; or to submit his case to the decision of a jury; preferred the latter; deeming it the readiest mode of obtaining his liberation; and the result has fully sustained the wisdom of his choice. The manner in which the issue submitted was tried will satisfy the English Government that the principles of justice will never fail to govern the enlightened decision of an American tribunal. I can not fail; however; to suggest to Congress the propriety; and in some degree the necessity; of making such provisions by law; so far as they may constitutionally do so; for the removal at their commencement and at the option of the party of all such cases as may hereafter arise; and which may involve the faithful observance and execution of our international obligations; from the State to the Federal judiciary. This Government; by our institutions; is charged with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relations with the nations of the earth; and ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper means of maintaining the one and preserving the other. While just confidence is felt in the judiciary of the States; yet this Government ought to be competent in itself for the fulfillment of the high duties which have been devolved upon it under the organic law by the States themselves. In the month of September a party of armed men from Upper Canada invaded the territory of the United States and forcibly seized upon the person of one Grogan; and under circumstances of great harshness hurriedly carried him beyond the limits of the United States and delivered him up to the authorities of Upper Canada. His immediate discharge was ordered by those authorities upon the facts of the case being brought to their knowledgeâ€”a course of procedure which was to have been expected from a nation with whom we are at peace; and which was not more due to the rights of the United States than to its own regard for justice. The correspondence which passed between the Department of State and the British envoy; Mr. Fox; and with the governor of Vermont; as soon as the facts had been made known to this department; are herewith communicated. I regret that it is not in my power to make known to you an equally satisfactory conclusion in the case of the Caroline steamer; with the circumstances connected with the destruction of which; in December; 1837; by an armed force fitted out in the Province of Upper Canada; you are already made acquainted. No such atonement as was due for the public wrong done to the United States by this invasion of her territory; so wholly irreconcilable with her rights as an independent power; has yet been made. In the view taken by this Government the inquiry whether the vessel was in the employment of those who were prosecuting an unauthorized war against that Province or was engaged by the owner in the business of transporting passengers to and from Navy Island in hopes of private gain; which was most probably the case; in no degree alters the real question at issue between the two Governments. This Government can never concede to any foreign government the power; except in a case of the most urgent and extreme necessity; of invading its territory; either to arrest the persons or destroy the property of those who may have violated the municipal laws of such foreign government or have disregarded their obligations arising under the law of nations. The territory of the United States must be regarded as sacredly secure against all such invasions until they shall voluntarily acknowledge their inability to acquit themselves of their duties to others. And in announcing this sentiment I do but affirm a principle which no nation on earth would be more ready to vindicate at all hazards than the people and Government of Great Britain. If upon a full investigation of all the facts it shall appear that the owner of the Caroline was governed by a hostile intent or had made common cause with those who were in the occupancy of Navy Island; then so far as he is concerned there can be no claim to indemnity for the destruction of his boat which this Government would feel itself bound to prosecute; since he would have acted not only in derogation of the rights of Great Britain; but in clear violation of the laws of the United States; but that is a question which; however settled; in no manner involves the higher consideration of the violation of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction. To recognize it as an admissible practice that each Government in its turn; upon any sudden and unauthorized outbreak which; on a frontier the extent of which renders it impossible for either to have an efficient force on every mile of it; and which outbreak; therefore; neither may be able to suppress in a day; may take vengeance into its own hands; and without even a remonstrance; and in the absence of any pressing or overruling necessity may invade the territory of the other; would inevitably lead to results equally to be deplored by both. When border collisions come to receive the sanction or to be made on the authority of either Government general war must be the inevitable result. While it is the ardent desire of the United States to cultivate the relations of peace with all nations and to fulfill all the duties of good neighborhood toward those who possess territories adjoining their own; that very desire would lead them to deny the right of any foreign power to invade their boundary with an armed force. The correspondence between the two Governments on this subject will at a future day of your session be submitted to your consideration; and in the meantime I can not but indulge the hope that the British Government will see the propriety of renouncing as a rule of future action the precedent which has been set in the affair at Schlosser. I herewith submit the correspondence which has recently taken place between the American minister at the Court of St. James; Mr. Stevenson; and the minister of foreign affairs of that Government on the right claimed by that Government to visit and detain vessels sailing under the American flag and engaged in prosecuting lawful commerce in the African seas. Our commercial interests in that region have experienced considerable increase and have become an object of much importance; and it is the duty of this Government to protect them against all improper and vexatious interruption. However desirous the United States may be for the suppression of the slave trade; they can not consent to interpolations into the maritime code at the mere will and pleasure of other governments. We deny the right of any such interpolation to any one or all the nations of the earth without our consent. We claim to have a voice in all amendments or alterations of that code; and when we are given to understand; as in this instance; by a foreign government that its treaties with other nations can not be executed without the establishment and enforcement of new principles of maritime police; to be applied without our consent; we must employ a language neither of equivocal import or susceptible of misconstruction. American citizens prosecuting a lawful commerce in the African seas under the flag of their country are not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that flag by others; nor can they rightfully on account of any such alleged abuses be interrupted; molested; or detained while on the ocean; and if thus molested and detained while pursuing honest voyages in the usual way and violating no law themselves they are unquestionably entitled to indemnity. This Government has manifested its repugnance to the slave trade in a manner which can not be misunderstood. By its fundamental law it prescribed limits in point of time to its continuance; and against its own citizens who might so far forget the rights of humanity as to engage in that wicked traffic it has long since by its municipal laws denounced the most condign punishment. Many of the States composing this Union had made appeals to the civilized world for its suppression long before the moral sense of other nations had become shocked by the iniquities of the traffic. Whether this Government should now enter into treaties containing mutual stipulations upon this subject is a question for its mature deliberation. Certain it is that if the right to detain American ships on the high seas can be justified on the plea of a necessity for such detention arising out of the existence of treaties between other nations; the same plea may; be extended and enlarged by the new stipulations of new treaties to which the United States may not be a party. This Government will not cease to urge upon that of Great Britain full and ample remuneration for all losses; whether arising from detention or otherwise; to which American citizens have heretofore been or may hereafter be subjected by the exercise of rights which this Government can not recognize as legitimate and proper. Nor will I indulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of Great Britain will constrain her to make retribution for any wrong or loss which any American citizen engaged in the prosecution of lawful commerce may have experienced at the hands of her cruisers or other public authorities. This Government; at the same time; will relax no effort to prevent its citizens; if there be any so disposed; from prosecuting a traffic so revolting to the feelings of humanity. It seeks to do no more than to protect the fair and honest trader from molestation and injury; but while the enterprising mariner engaged in the pursuit of an honorable trade is entitled to its protection; it will visit with condign punishment others of an opposite character. I invite your attention to existing laws for the suppression of the African slave trade; and recommend all such alterations as may give to them greater force and efficacy. That the American flag is grossly abused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations is but too probable. Congress has not long since had this subject under its consideration; and its importance well justifies renewed and anxious attention. I also communicate herewith the copy of a correspondence between Mr. Stevenson and Lord Palmerston upon the subject; so interesting to several of the Southern States; of the rice duties; which resulted honorably to the justice of Great Britain and advantageously to the United States. At the opening of the last annual session the President informed Congress of the progress which had then been made in negotiating a convention between this Government and that of England with a view to the final settlement of the question of the boundary between the territorial limits of the two countries. I regret to say that little further advancement of the object has been accomplished since last year; but this is owing to circumstances no way indicative of any abatement of the desire of both parties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion and to settle the question in dispute as early as possible. In the course of the session it is my hope to be able to announce some further degree of progress toward the accomplishment of this highly desirable end. The commission appointed by this Government for the exploration and survey of the line of boundary separating the States of Maine and New Hampshire from the conterminous British Provinces is; it is believed; about to close its field labors and is expected soon to report the results of its examinations to the Department of State. The report; when received; will be laid before Congress. The failure on the part of Spain to pay with punctuality the interest due under the convention of 1834 for the settlement of claims between the two countries has made it the duty of the Executive to call the particular attention of that Government to the subject. A disposition has been manifested by it; which is believed to be entirely sincere; to fulfill its obligations in this respect so soon as its internal condition and the state of its finances will permit. An arrangement is in progress from the result of which it is trusted that those of our citizens who have claims under the convention will at no distant day receive the stipulated payments. A treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium was concluded and signed at Washington on the 29th of March; 1840; and was duly sanctioned by the Senate of the United States. The treaty was ratified by His Belgian Majesty; but did not receive the approbation of the Belgian Chambers within the time limited by its terms; and has therefore become void. This occurrence assumes the graver aspect from the consideration that in 1833 a treaty negotiated between the two Governments and ratified on the part of the United States failed to be ratified on the part of Belgium. The representative of that Government at Washington informs the Department of State that he has been instructed to give explanations of the causes which occasioned delay in the approval of the late treaty by the legislature; and to express the regret of the King at the occurrence. The joint commission under the convention with Texas to ascertain the true boundary between the two countries has concluded its labors; but the final report of the commissioner of the United States has not been received. It is understood; however; that the meridian line as traced by the commission lies somewhat farther east than the position hitherto generally assigned to it; and consequently includes in Texas some part of the territory which had been considered as belonging to the States of Louisiana and Arkansas. The United States can not but take a deep interest in whatever relates to this young but growing Republic. Settled principally by emigrants from the United States; we have the happiness to know that the great principles of civil liberty are there destined to flourish under wise institutions and wholesome laws; and that through its example another evidence is to be afforded of the capacity of popular institutions to advance the prosperity; happiness; and permanent glory of the human race. The great truth that government was made for the people and not the people for government has already been established in the practice and by the example of these United States; and we can do no other than contemplate its further exemplification by a sister republic with the deepest interest. Our relations with the independent States of this hemisphere; formerly under the dominion of Spain; have not undergone any material change within the past year. The incessant sanguinary conflicts in or between those countries are to be greatly deplored as necessarily tending to disable them from performing their duty as members of the community of nations and rising to the destiny which the position and natural resources of many of them might lead them justly to anticipate; as constantly giving occasion also; directly or indirectly; for complaints on the part of our citizens who resort thither for purposes of commercial intercourse; and as retarding reparation for wrongs already committed; some of which are by no means of recent date. The failure of the Congress of Ecuador to hold a session at the time appointed for that purpose; in January last; will probably render abortive a treaty of commerce with that Republic; which was signed at Quito on the 13th of June; 1839; and had been duly ratified on our part; but which required the approbation of that body prior to its ratification by the Ecuadorian Executive. A convention which has been concluded with the Republic of Peru; providing for the settlement of certain claims of citizens of the United States upon the Government of that Republic; will be duly submitted to the Senate. The claims of our citizens against the Brazilian Government originating from captures and other causes are still unsatisfied. The United States have; however; so uniformly shown a disposition to cultivate relations of amity with that Empire that it is hoped the unequivocal tokens of the same spirit toward us which an adjustment of the affairs referred to would afford will be given without further avoidable delay. The war with the Indian tribes on the peninsula of Florida has during the last summer and fall been prosecuted with untiring activity and zeal. A summer campaign was resolved upon as the best mode of bringing it to a close. Our brave officers and men who have been engaged in that service have suffered toils and privations and exhibited an energy which in any other war would have won for them unfading laurels. In despite of the sickness incident to the climate; they have penetrated the fastnesses of the Indians; broken up their encampments; and harassed them unceasingly. Numbers have been captured; and still greater numbers have surrendered and have been transported to join their brethren on the lands elsewhere allotted to them by the Government; and a strong hope is entertained that under the conduct of the gallant officer at the head of the troops in Florida that troublesome and expensive war is destined to a speedy termination. With all the other Indian tribes we are enjoying the blessings of peace. Our duty as well as our best interests prompts us to observe in all our intercourse with them fidelity in fulfilling our engagements; the practice of strict justice; as well as the constant exercise of acts of benevolence and kindness. These are the great instruments of civilization; and through the use of them alone can the untutored child of the forest be induced to listen to its teachings. The Secretary of State; on whom the acts of Congress have devolved the duty of directing the proceedings for the taking of the sixth census or enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States; will report to the two Houses the progress of that work. The enumeration of persons has been completed; and exhibits a grand total of 17;069;453; making an increase over the census of 1830 of 4;202;646 inhabitants; and showing a gain in a ratio exceeding 32 1/2 per cent for the last ten years. From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury you will be informed of the condition of the finances. The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last; as stated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury submitted to Congress at the extra session; was $987;345.03. The receipts into the Treasury during the first three quarters of this year from all sources amount to $23;467;072.52; the estimated receipts for the fourth quarter amount to $6;943;095.25; amounting to $30;410;167.77; and making with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last $31;397;512.80. The expenditures for the first three quarters of this year amount to $24;734;346.97. The expenditures for the fourth quarter as estimated will amount to $7;290;723.73; thus making a total of $32;025;070.70; and leaving a deficit to be provided for on the 1st of January next of about $627;557.90. Of the loan of $12;000;000 which was authorized by Congress at its late session only $5;432;726.88 have been negotiated. The shortness of time which it had to run has presented no inconsiderable impediment in the way of its being taken by capitalists at home; while the same cause would have operated with much greater force in the foreign market. For that reason the foreign market has not been resorted to; and it is now submitted whether it would not be advisable to amend the law by making what remains undisposed of payable at a more distant day. Should it be necessary; in any view that Congress may take of the subject; to revise the existing tariff of duties; I beg leave to say that in the performance of that most delicate operation moderate counsels would seem to be the wisest. The Government under which it is our happiness to live owes its existence to the spirit of compromise which prevailed among its framers; jarring and discordant opinions could only have been reconciled by that noble spirit of patriotism which prompted conciliation and resulted in harmony. In the same spirit the compromise bill; as it is commonly called; was adopted at the session of 1833. While the people of no portion of the Union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary taxes for the support of Government; yet an innate repugnance exists to the imposition of burthens not really necessary for that object. In imposing duties; however; for the purposes of revenue a right to discriminate as to the articles on which the duty shall be laid; as well as the amount; necessarily and most properly exists; otherwise the Government would be placed in the condition of having to levy the same duties upon all articles; the productive as well as the unproductive. The slightest duty upon some might have the effect of causing their importation to cease; whereas others; entering extensively into the consumption of the country; might bear the heaviest without any sensible diminution in the amount imported. So also the Government may be justified in so discriminating by reference to other considerations of domestic policy connected with our manufactures. So long as the duties shall be laid with distinct reference to the wants of the Treasury no well-rounded objection can exist against them. It might be esteemed desirable that no such augmentation of the taxes should take place as would have the effect of annulling the land-proceeds distribution act of the last session; which act is declared to be inoperative the moment the duties are increased beyond 20 per cent; the maximum rate established by the compromise act. Some of the provisions of the compromise act; which will go into effect on the 30th day of June next; may; however; be found exceedingly inconvenient in practice under any regulations that Congress may adopt. I refer more particularly to that relating to the home valuation. A difference in value of the same articles to some extent will necessarily exist at different ports; but that is altogether insignificant when compared with the conflicts in valuation which are likely to arise from the differences of opinion among the numerous appraisers of merchandise. In many instances the estimates of value must be conjectural; and thus as many different rates of value may be established as there are appraisers. These differences in valuation may also be increased by the inclination which; without the slightest imputation on their honesty; may arise on the part of the appraisers in favor of their respective ports of entry. I recommend this whole subject to the consideration of Congress with a single additional remark. Certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy are in all respects eminently desirable; but more particularly is this true in all that affects trade and commerce; the operations of which depend much more on the certainty of their returns and calculations which embrace distant periods of time than on high bounties or duties; which are liable to constant fluctuations. At your late session I invited your attention to the condition of the currency and exchanges and urged the necessity of adopting such measures as were consistent with the constitutional competency of the Government in order to correct the unsoundness of the one and; as far as practicable; the inequalities of the other. No country can be in the enjoyment of its full measure of prosperity without the presence of a medium of exchange approximating to uniformity of value. What is necessary as between the different nations of the earth is also important as between the inhabitants of different parts of the same country. With the first the precious metals constitute the chief medium of circulation; and such also would be the case as to the last but for inventions comparatively modern; which have furnished in place of gold and silver a paper circulation. I do not propose to enter into a comparative analysis of the merits of the two systems. Such belonged more properly to the period of the introduction of the paper system. The speculative philosopher might find inducements to prosecute the inquiry; but his researches could only lead him to conclude that the paper system had probably better never have been introduced and that society might have been much happier without it. The practical statesman has a very different task to perform. He has to look at things as they are; to take them as he finds them; to supply deficiencies and to prune excesses as far as in him lies. The task of furnishing a corrective for derangements of the paper medium with us is almost inexpressibly great. The power exerted by the States to charter banking corporations; and which; having been carried to a great excess; has filled the country with; in most of the States; an irredeemable paper medium; is an evil which in some way or other requires a corrective. The rates at which bills of exchange are negotiated between different parts of the country furnish an index of the value of the local substitute for gold and silver; which is in many parts so far depreciated as not to be received except at a large discount in payment of debts or in the purchase of produce. It could earnestly be desired that every bank not possessing the means of resumption should follow the example of the late United States Bank of Pennsylvania and go into liquidation rather than by refusing to do so to continue embarrassments in the way of solvent institutions; thereby augmenting the difficulties incident to the present condition of things. Whether this Government; with due regard to the rights of the States; has any power to constrain the banks either to resume specie payments or to force them into liquidation; is an inquiry which will not fail to claim your consideration. In view of the great advantages which are allowed the corporators; not among the least of which is the authority contained in most of their charters to make loans to three times the amount of their capital; thereby often deriving three times as much interest on the same amount of money as any individual is permitted by law to receive; no sufficient apology can be urged for a long-continued suspension of specie payments. Such suspension is productive of the greatest detriment to the public by expelling from circulation the precious metals and seriously hazarding the success of any effort that this Government can make to increase commercial facilities and to advance the public interests. This is the more to be regretted and the indispensable necessity for a sound currency becomes the more manifest when we reflect on the vast amount of the internal commerce of the country. Of this we have no statistics nor just data for forming adequate opinions. But there can be no doubt but that the amount of transportation coastwise by sea; and the transportation inland by railroads and canals; and by steamboats and other modes of conveyance over the surface of our vast rivers and immense lakes; and the value of property carried and interchanged by these means form a general aggregate to which the foreign commerce of the country; large as it is; makes but a distant approach. In the absence of any controlling power over this subject; which; by forcing a general resumption of specie payments; would at once have the effect of restoring a sound medium of exchange and would leave to the country but little to desire; what measure of relief falling within the limits of our constitutional competency does it become this Government to adopt? It was my painful duty at your last session; under the weight of most solemn obligations; to differ with Congress on the measures which it proposed for my approval; and which it doubtless regarded as corrective of existing evils. Subsequent reflection and events since occurring have only served to confirm me in the opinions then entertained and frankly expressed. I must be permitted to add that no scheme of governmental policy unaided by individual exertions can be available for ameliorating the present condition of things. Commercial modes of exchange and a good currency are but the necessary means of commerce and intercourse; not the direct productive sources of wealth. Wealth can only be accumulated by the earnings of industry and the savings of frugality; and nothing can be more ill judged than to look to facilities in borrowing or to a redundant circulation for the power of discharging pecuniary obligations. The country is full of resources and the people fall of energy; and the great and permanent remedy for present embarrassments must be sought in industry; economy; the observance of good faith; and the favorable influence of time. In pursuance of a pledge given to you in my last message to Congress; which pledge I urge as an apology for adventuring to present you the details of any plan; the Secretary of the Treasury will be ready to submit to you; should you require it; a plan of finance which; while it throws around the public treasure reasonable guards for its protection and rests on powers acknowledged in practice to exist from the origin of the Government; will at the same time furnish to the country a sound paper medium
